<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p>"The Attorney-General did his work very fairly, I thought&mdash;eh,
Lynx?" said Mr. Subtle, as arm-in-arm with Mr.
Lynx, he quitted the Castle-gates, each of them on his way
to their respective lodgings, to prepare for the next day's
work.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;he's a keen hand, to be sure: he's given us <i>all</i>
work enough; and I must say, it's been a capital set-to
between you! I'm <i>very</i> glad you got the verdict!"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have done to be beaten on one's own
dung-hill, as it were&mdash;eh? By the way, Lynx, that was
a good hit of yours about the erasure&mdash;I ought, really,
if it had occurred to me at the time, to have given you
the credit of it&mdash;'twas entirely yours, Lynx, I must
say."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!"&mdash;replied Lynx, modestly. "It was a mere
accident my lighting on it; the merit was, the use you
made of it!"</p>

<p>"To think of ten thousand a-year turning on that same
trumpery erasure!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But are you sure of our verdict on that ground, Mr.
Subtle? Do you think Lord Widdrington was right in
rejecting that deed?"<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"Right? to be sure he was! But I own I got rather
uneasy at the way the Attorney-General put it&mdash;that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the estate had once been vested, and could not be subsequently
de-vested by an alteration or blemish in the instrument
evidencing the passing of the estate&mdash;eh? that
was a good point, Lynx."</p>

<p>"Ay, but as Lord Widdrington put it&mdash;that could
be only where the defect was proved to exist after a complete
and valid deed had been once established."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;true; that's the answer, Lynx; here, you see,
the deed is disgraced in the first instance; no proof, in
fact, that it ever <i>was</i> a deed&mdash;therefore, mere waste
paper."</p>

<p>"To be sure, <i>possession</i> has gone along with the
deed"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Possession gone along with it!&mdash;What then?&mdash;That
is to say, the man who has altered it, to benefit himself
and his heirs, keeps it snugly in his own chest&mdash;and then
that is of itself to be sufficient to"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;but what I'm afraid of, is this: that the presumption
of forgery arising from the alteration, is overcome
by the presumption to the contrary, arising from
long-continued and consistent possession!&mdash;On the other
hand, however, it is certainly a general rule that the
party producing an instrument must account for the
appearance of erasure or alteration, to encounter the
presumption of fraud!&mdash;I must say <i>that</i> seems good
sense enough!"...</p>

<p>"It's really been a very interesting cause," said Mr.
Subtle.</p>

<p>"Very. Some capital points&mdash;that of Mortmain's on
the stamp act"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pish, Lynx! there's nothing in it! I meant the cause
itself has been an interesting one&mdash;uncommonly."</p>

<p>Mr. Subtle suddenly paused and stood still. "God bless
my soul, Lynx&mdash;I've made a blunder!"</p>

<p>"Eh!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;by Jove, a blunder! Never did such a thing
since I've led a cause before!"</p>

<p>"A blunder? Impossible!&mdash;What is it?" inquired
Lynx, briskly, pricking up his ears.</p>

<p>"It will be at least thirty or forty pounds out of our
client's pocket. I forgot to ask Widdrington for the certificate
for the costs of the special jury. I protest I never
did such a thing before&mdash;I'm quite annoyed&mdash;I hate
to <i>overlook</i> anything."</p>

<p>"Oh! is that all?" inquired Lynx, much relieved&mdash;"then
it's all right! While you were speaking to Mr.
Gammon, immediately after the verdict had been given, I
turned towards Quicksilver to get him to ask for the certificate&mdash;but
he had seen a man with the new 'Times'
containing the Division on the Catholic claims, and had
set off after him&mdash;so I took the liberty, as you seemed
very earnestly talking to Mr. Gammon, to name it to the
judge&mdash;and it's all right."</p>

<p>"Capital!&mdash;Then there isn't a single point missed!&mdash;And
in a good two days' fight that's something."</p>

<p>"D'ye think we shall keep the verdict, and get its
fruits?"</p>

<p>"We shall keep the verdict, I've no doubt; there's
nothing in Widdrington's notes that we need be afraid of&mdash;but
of course the Aubreys will put us to bring another
ejectment, perhaps several."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;certainly&mdash;there <i>must</i> be a good deal of fighting
before such a property as Yatton changes hands,"
replied Lynx, with a complacent air; for he saw a few
pleasant pickings in store for him. "By the way," he
continued, "our client's a sweet specimen of humanity,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Faugh! odious little reptile! And did you ever in
all your life witness such a scene as when he interrupted
me in the way he did?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Never! But, upon my honor, what an exquisite
turn you gave the thing&mdash;it was worth more
than called it forth&mdash;it was admirable."</p>

<p>"Pooh&mdash;Lynx!" said Mr. Subtle, with a gratified air;
"knack&mdash;mere knack&mdash;nothing more. My voice trembled&mdash;eh?&mdash;at
least so I intended."</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, I almost believed you were for the
moment overcome, and going to shed tears."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha, ha!&mdash;Delightful! I was convulsed with inward
laughter! <i>Shed tears!!</i> Did the bar take it, Lynx?"
inquired Mr. Subtle; for though he hated display, he loved
<i>appreciation</i>, and by competent persons. "By the way,
Lynx, the way in which you've got up the whole case
does you vast credit&mdash;that opinion of yours on the evidence
was&mdash;upon my word&mdash;the most masterly"&mdash;here
he suddenly ceased and squeezed his companion's
arm, motioning him thereby to silence. They had come
up with two gentlemen, walking slowly, and conversing
in a low tone, but with much earnestness of manner.
They were, in fact, Mr. Aubrey and Lord De la Zouch.
Mr. Subtle and Mr. Lynx crossed over to the other side
of the narrow street, and quickened their pace, so as
soon to be out of sight and hearing of the persons they
seemed desirous of avoiding. Mr. Subtle was, indeed,
unable to bear the sight of the man whom his strenuous
and splendid exertions during the last two days had
tended to strip of his all&mdash;to thrust from the bright
domain of wealth, prosperity, distinction, into&mdash;as it
were&mdash;outer darkness&mdash;the outer darkness of poverty&mdash;of
destitution.</p>

<p>"It's rather a nuisance for the Aubreys&mdash;isn't it?"
quoth the matter-of-fact Lynx.</p>

<p>"It's quite frightful!"&mdash;replied Mr. Subtle, in a tone
of voice and with a manner which showed how deeply
he felt what he uttered. "And it's not only what Mr.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Aubrey will lose, but what he will be liable to&mdash;the
mesne profits&mdash;sixty thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;you think, then, that we can't go beyond the
<i>statute of limitations</i>?&mdash;Eh?&mdash;is that so clear?" Mr.
Subtle looked sharply at Lynx, with an expression it
would be difficult to describe. "Well"&mdash;continued the
impenetrable Lynx&mdash;"at all events, I'll look into it." He
felt about as much <i>sentiment</i> in the matter as a hog eating
acorns would feel interest in the antiquity of the oak from
which they fell, and under whose venerable shade he was
munching and stuffing himself.</p>

<p>"By the way, Lynx&mdash;aren't you with me in <i>Higson
and Mellington</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and it stands first for to-morrow morning!"</p>

<p>"I've not opened my papers, and&mdash;why, we've a consultation
fixed for ten o'clock to-night! What's it all
about?"</p>

<p>"It's <i>libel</i> against a newspaper editor&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Pomfret
Cockatrice</span>; and our client's a clergyman. They've
slandered him most abominably: they say he entered the
church as a wholesale dealer in tithes&mdash;and as to religion&mdash;is
an unbeliever and hypocrite!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay?&mdash;that sounds a little like substantial damages!&mdash;Do
they <i>justify</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"No&mdash;they've pleaded not guilty only."</p>

<p>"Who leads for the defender?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Quicksilver."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;very well. We must have the consultation to-morrow
morning, at the Robing-room&mdash;ten minutes before
the sitting of the court. I'm rather tired to-night."
With this the great leader shook hands with his modest,
learned, laborious junior&mdash;and entered his lodgings.</p>

<p>As soon as Titmouse had been ejected from the court, in
the summary way which the reader will recollect, merely
on account of his having, with some slight indecorum,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
yielded to the mighty impulse of his agitated feelings,
he began to cry bitterly, wringing his hands, and asking
every one about him if they thought he could get in
again, because it was "<i>his</i> case" that was going on. His
eyes were red and swollen with weeping; and his little
breast throbbed violently as he walked to and fro from
one door of the court to the other. "Oh, gents, will you
get me in again?" said he, in passionate tones, approaching
two gentlemen, who, with a very anxious and oppressed
air, were standing together at the outside of one of the
doors&mdash;in fact, Lord De la Zouch and Mr. Aubrey; and
they quickly recognized in Titmouse the gentleman whose
claims were being at that instant mooted within the court.
"<i>Will</i> you get me in? You seem such <i>respectable</i> gents&mdash;'Pon
my soul I'm going mad! It's my case that's
going on! I'm Mr. Titmouse"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have no power, sir, to get you in," replied Lord
De la Zouch, haughtily: so coldly and sternly as to cause
Titmouse involuntarily to shrink from him.</p>

<p>"The court is crowded to the very door, sir&mdash;and we
really have no more right to be present in court, or get
others into court, than you have," said Mr. Aubrey, with
mildness and dignity.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir! Thank you!" quoth Titmouse, moving
with an apprehensive air away from Lord De la Zouch,
towards Mr. Aubrey, "Know quite well who you are, sir!
'Pon my solemn soul, sir, sorry to do all this; but law's
law, and right's right, all the world over!"</p>

<p>"I <i>desire</i> you to leave us, sir," said Lord De la Zouch,
with irrepressible sternness; "you are very intrusive.
How can we catch a syllable of what is going on while
you are chattering in this way?" Titmouse saw that
Mr. Aubrey looked towards him with a very different
expression from that exhibited by his forbidding companion,
and would perhaps have stood his ground, but for a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
glimpse he caught of a huge, powdered, broad-shouldered
footman, in a splendid livery, one of Lord De la Zouch's
servants, who, with a great thick silver-headed cane in his
hand, was standing at a little distance behind, in attendance
on the carriage, which was in the Castle-yard. This
man's face looked so ready for mischief, that Titmouse
slowly walked off. There were a good many standers-by,
who seemed all to look with dislike and distrust at Titmouse.
He made many ineffectual attempts to persuade
the doorkeeper, who had assisted in his extrusion, to readmit
him; but the incorruptible janitor was proof against
a sixpence&mdash;even against a shilling; and at length Titmouse
gave himself up to despair, and thought himself
the most miserable man in the whole world&mdash;as very
probably, indeed, he was: for consider what a horrid interval
of suspense he had to endure, from the closing of
Mr. Subtle's speech, till the delivery of the verdict. But
at length, through this portentous and apparently impenetrable
cloud burst the rich sunlight of success.</p>

<p>"Mr. Titmouse!&mdash;Mr. Titmouse!&mdash;Mr. Tit"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here! Here I am! Here!"&mdash;exclaimed the little
wretch, jumping off the window-seat on which he had been
sitting for the last hour in the dark, half-stupefied with
grief and exhaustion. The voice which called him was a
blessed voice&mdash;a familiar voice&mdash;the voice of Mr. Gammon;
who, as soon as the jury had begun to come back, on
some pretence or other had quitted his seat between Quirk
and Snap, in order, if the verdict should be for the plaintiff,
to be the very first to communicate it to him. In a
moment or two Mr. Gammon had grasped both Mr. Titmouse's
hands. "My dear, dear Mr. Titmouse, I congratulate
you! You are victorious! God grant you
long life to enjoy your good fortune! God bless you,
Titmouse!" He wrung Titmouse's hands&mdash;and his voice
trembled with the intensity of his emotions! Mr. Titmouse
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
had grown very white, and for a while spoke not,
but stood staring at Mr. Gammon, as if hardly aware of
the import of his communication.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but&mdash;is it so? Honor bright?" at length he
stammered.</p>

<p>"It is indeed! My long labors are at length crowned
with success!&mdash;Hurrah, hurrah, Mr. Titmouse!"</p>

<p>"I've really <i>won</i>? It a'n't a joke or a dream?" inquired
Titmouse, with quickly increasing excitement, and
a joyous expression bursting over his features, which became
suddenly flushed.</p>

<p>"A joke?&mdash;the best you'll ever have. A dream?&mdash;that
will last your life. Thank God, Mr. Titmouse, the
battle's ours; we've defeated all their villany!"</p>

<p>"Tol de rol! Tol de rol! Tol de lol, lol, lol, rido!&mdash;Ah,"
he added in a loud truculent tone, as Lord De la
Zouch and Mr. Aubrey slowly passed him&mdash;"done for
you now&mdash;'pon my life!&mdash;turned the tables!&mdash;<i>that</i> for
you!" said he, snapping his fingers; but I need hardly
say that he did so with perfect impunity, as far as those
two gentlemen were concerned, who were so absorbed with
the grievous event which had just happened, as scarcely
to be aware of their being addressed at all.</p>

<p>"Aubrey, it's against you&mdash;all is lost; the verdict is
for the plaintiff!" said Lord De la Zouch, in a hurried
agitated whisper, as he grasped the hand of Mr. Aubrey,
whom he had quitted for an instant to hear the verdict
pronounced. Mr. Aubrey for some moments spoke not.</p>

<p>"God's will be done!" at length said he, in a low tone,
or rather in a faint murmur. More than a dozen gentlemen,
who came crowding out, grasped his hand with fervent
energy.</p>

<p>"God bless you, Aubrey! God bless you!" said several
voices, their speakers wringing his hands with great
vehemence as they spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us go"&mdash;said Lord De la Zouch, putting Mr.
Aubrey's arm in his own, and leading him away from a
scene of distressing excitement, too powerful for his exhausted
feelings.</p>

<p>"I am nothing of a fatalist," said Mr. Aubrey, after a
considerable pause, during which they had quitted the
Castle-gates, and his feelings had recovered from the shock
which they had just before suffered;&mdash;"I am nothing of
a fatalist, but I ought not to feel the least surprise at this
issue, for I have long had a settled conviction that such
<i>would</i> be the issue. For some time before I had the least
intimation of the commencement of these proceedings, I
was oppressed by a sense of impending calamity"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, that may be so; but it does not follow that the
mischief is finally <i>done</i>."</p>

<p>"I am certain of it!&mdash;But, dear Lord De la Zouch,
how much I owe to your kindness and sympathy!" said
Mr. Aubrey, with a slight tremor in his voice.</p>

<p>"We are at this moment, Aubrey, firmer friends than
we ever were before. So help me Heaven! I would
not lose your friendship for the world; I feel it a greater
honor than I am worthy of&mdash;I do, indeed," said Lord De
la Zouch, with great emotion.</p>

<p>"There's a great gulf between us, though, Lord De la
Zouch, as far as worldly circumstances are concerned&mdash;you
a peer of the realm, I a beggar!"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Aubrey, but it is idle to talk in that
way; I am hurt beyond measure at your supposing it
possible that under any circumstances"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Believe me, I feel the full value of your friendship&mdash;more
valuable at this moment than ever!"</p>

<p>"That a serious calamity has fallen upon you is certain;&mdash;which
of us, indeed, is safe from such a calamity?
But who would bear it with the calm fortitude which <i>you</i>
have already evinced, my dear Aubrey?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"You speak very kindly, Lord De la Zouch; I trust I
shall play the man, now that the time for playing a man's
part has come," said Mr. Aubrey, with an air of mingled
melancholy and resolution. "I feel an inexpressible consolation
in the reflection, that I cannot charge myself with
anything unconscientious; and, as for the future, I put
my trust in God. I feel as if I could submit to the will
of Heaven with cheerfulness"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't speak so despondingly, Aubrey"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Despondingly?" echoed Mr. Aubrey, with momentary
animation&mdash;"Despondingly? My dear friend, I feel as
if I were indeed entering a scene black as midnight&mdash;but
what is it to the <i>valley of the shadow of death</i>, dear Lord
De la Zouch, which is before all of us, and at but a little
distance! I assure you I feel no vain-glorious confidence;
yet I seem to be leaning on the arm of an unseen but all-powerful
supporter!"</p>

<p>"You are a hero, my dear Aubrey!" exclaimed Lord
De la Zouch, with sudden fervor.</p>

<p>"And that support will embrace those dearer to me
than life&mdash;dearer&mdash;far&mdash;far"&mdash;&mdash;He ceased; his feelings
quite overcame him, and they walked on for some
time in silence. Soon afterwards they parted&mdash;for Lord
De la Zouch perceived that his unfortunate companion
wished to be alone. He wrung Mr. Aubrey's hands in
silence; and having turned in the direction of his hotel,
Mr. Aubrey made for his lodgings. The streets were occupied
by passengers, some returning from the Castle after
the great trial of the day; others standing here and there,
in little knots, conversing as he passed them; and he felt
conscious that the subject of their thoughts and conversation
was himself and his fallen fortunes. Several deep-drawn
sighs escaped him, as he walked on, the herald of
such dismal tidings, to those whom he loved; and he felt
but for that which supported him from within, as it were,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
a fallen angel, so far as concerned this world's honors and
greatness. The splendors of human pomp and prosperity
seemed rapidly vanishing in the distance. In the temporary
depression of his spirits, he experienced feelings
somewhat akin to those of the heart-sickened exile, whose
fond eyes are riveted upon the mosques and minarets of
his native city, glittering in the soft sunlight of evening,
where are the cherished objects of all his tenderest thoughts
and feelings; while his vessel is rapidly bearing him from
it, amid the rising wind, the increasing and ominous swell
of the waters, the thickening gloom of night&mdash;<i>whither</i>?
The Minster clock struck ten as he passed one of the corners
of the vast majestic structure, gray-glistening in the
faint moonlight. The melodious chimes echoed in his ear,
and smote his subdued soul with a sense of peculiar solemnity
and awe; they forced upon him a reflection upon
the transient littleness of earthly things. Then he thought
of those dear beings who were awaiting his return, and a
gush of grief and tenderness overflowed his heart, as he
quickened his steps, with an inward and fervent prayer
that Heaven would support them under the misfortune
which had befallen them. As he neared the retired row
of houses where his lodgings were situated, he imagined
that he saw some one near the door, as if on the look-out
for his approach; and who, as he drew nearer, suddenly
entered them, and closed the door. This was a person
whom Mr. Aubrey did not at all suspect&mdash;it was his
worthy friend Dr. Tatham; who, unable to quit Yatton
in time to hear the trial, had early that morning mounted
his horse, and after a long and hard ride, reached York
soon after Mr. Aubrey had set off for the Castle. Though
many of the county people then in York were aware that
Mrs. and Miss Aubrey were also there, a delicate consideration
for their exquisitely distressing situation restrained
them from intruding upon their privacy, which had been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
evidently sought for by the species of lodgings which Mr.
Aubrey had engaged. On the second day, the excellent
Dr. Tatham had been their welcome and instructive guest,
scarce ever leaving them; Mr. Aubrey's groom bringing
word, from time to time, from his master, how the trial
went on. Late in the evening, urged by Kate, the doctor
had gone off to the Castle, to wait till he could bring intelligence
of the final result of the trial. He had not been
observed by Mr. Aubrey amid the number of people who
were about; and had at length fulfilled his mission, and
been beforehand with Mr. Aubrey in communicating the
unfortunate issue of the struggle. The instant that Mr.
Aubrey had set his foot within the door, he was locked in
the impassioned embrace of his wife and sister. None of
them spoke for some moments.</p>

<p>"Dearest Charles!&mdash;we've heard it all&mdash;we know it
all!" at length they exclaimed in a breath. "Thank
God, it is over at last&mdash;and we know the worst!&mdash;Are
you well, dearest Charles?" inquired Mrs. Aubrey, with
fond anxiety.</p>

<p>"Thank God, my Agnes, I am well!" said Mr. Aubrey,
much excited&mdash;"and thank God that the dreadful suspense
is at an end; and also for the fortitude, my sweet
loves, with which you bear the result. And how are <i>you</i>,
my excellent friend?" continued he, addressing Dr. Tatham,
and grasping his hands; "my venerable and pious
friend&mdash;how it refreshes my heart to see you! as one
of the chosen ministers of that God whose creatures
we are, and whose dispensations we receive with reverent
submission!"</p>

<p>"God Almighty bless you all, my dear friends!" replied
Dr. Tatham, powerfully affected. "Believe that all
this is from <span class="smcap">Him</span>! He has wise ends in view, though we
see not nor comprehend them! <i>Faint not when you are
rebuked of Him! If ye faint in the day of adversity, your</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<i>strength is small!</i> But I rejoice to see your resignation!"&mdash;Aubrey,
his wife, and sister, were for a while overcome
with their emotions.</p>

<p>"I assure you all," said Aubrey, "I feel as if a very
mountain had been lifted off my heart! How blessed am
I in such a wife and sister!" A heavenly smile irradiated
his pale features&mdash;and he clasped his wife, and then his
sister, in his arms. They wept as they tenderly returned
his embrace.</p>

<p>"God," said he, "that gave us all, has taken all: why
should we murmur? He will enable us, if we pray for
His assistance, to bear with equanimity our present adversity,
as well as our past prosperity! Come, Agnes!
Kate! play the woman!"</p>

<p>Dr. Tatham sat silent by; but the tears ran down his
cheeks. At length Mr. Aubrey gave them a general account
of what had occurred at the trial&mdash;and which, I
need hardly say, was listened to in breathless silence.</p>

<p>"Who is that letter from, love, lying on the table?" inquired
Mr. Aubrey, during a pause in the conversation.</p>

<p>"It's only from Johnson&mdash;dearest!&mdash;to say the children
are quite well," replied Mrs. Aubrey. The ruined
parents, as if by a common impulse, looked unutterable
things at each other. Then the mother turned deadly
pale; and her husband tenderly kissed her cold cheek;
while Kate could scarcely restrain her feelings. The excitement
of each was beginning to give way before sheer
bodily and mental exhaustion; and Dr. Tatham, observing
it, rose to take his departure. It was arranged that the
carriage should be at the door by eight o'clock in the
morning, to convey them back to Yatton&mdash;and that Dr.
Tatham should breakfast with them, and afterwards accompany
them on horseback. He then took his departure
for the night, with a very full heart; and those
whom he had left, soon afterwards retired for the night;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and having first invoked the mercy and pity of Heaven,
sank into slumber and brief forgetfulness of the perilous
position in which they had been placed by the event of
the day.</p>

<p>Somewhat different was the mode in which the night
was spent by the victorious party. Gammon, as has been
seen, was the first to congratulate Titmouse on his splendid
success. The next was old Quirk&mdash;who, with a sort
of conviction that he should find Gammon beforehand
with him&mdash;bustled out of court, leaving Snap to pay the
jury, settle the court-fees, collect the papers, and so forth.
Both Quirk and Snap (as soon as the latter was at liberty)
exhibited a courtesy towards Titmouse which had
a strong dash of reverence in it, such as was due to the
possessor of ten thousand a-year; but Gammon exhibited
the tranquil matter-of-fact confidence of a man who had
determined to be, and indeed knew that he <i>was</i>, the entire
master of Titmouse.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;wish you'd call a coach, or something of that
sort, gents.&mdash;I'm devilish tired&mdash;I am, 'pon my soul!"
said Mr. Titmouse, yawning, as he stood on the steps
between Quirk and Gammon, waiting for Snap's arrival.
He was, in fact, almost beside himself&mdash;bursting with excitement;
and could not stand still for a moment. Now
he whistled loudly, and boldly; then he hummed a bar
or two of some low comic song; and repeatedly drew on
and off his damp gloves, with an air of petulant impetuosity.
Now he ran his hand through his hair with careless
grace; and then, with arms folded on his breast for a
moment, looked eagerly, but with a would-be languid air,
at two or three elegant equipages, which, one by one,
with their depressed and disappointed occupants, rolled
off. At length, Lord Widdrington, amid a sharp impetuous
cry of "Make way for the judge there&mdash;make
way for my Lord!" appeared in his robes, (holding his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
three-cornered hat in his hand,) with a wearied air; and
passing close by Titmouse, was honored by him with a
very fine bow indeed&mdash;his Lordship not being, however,
in the least aware of the fact&mdash;as he passed on to his
carriage. The steps were drawn up; the door was closed;
and amid a sharp blast of trumpets, the carriage drove
slowly off, preceded and followed by the usual attendants.
All this pomp and ceremony made a very deep impression
upon the mind of Titmouse. "Ah," thought he,
with a sudden sigh of mingled excitement and exhaustion&mdash;"who
knows but <i>I</i> may be a judge some day?
It's a devilish pleasant thing, I'm sure! What a fuss he
must make wherever he goes! 'Pon my life, quite delightful!"
As there was no coach to be had, Mr. Titmouse
was forced to walk home, arm-in-arm with Mr.
Quirk and Mr. Gammon, and followed, at a little distance,
by a knot of persons, acquainted with his name and person,
and feeling towards him a strange mixture of emotions&mdash;dislike,
wonder, contempt, admiration. Goodness
gracious! that strange little gentleman was now worth,
it was said, ten thousand a-year; and was squire of Yatton!!
Old Quirk shook Titmouse's hand with irrepressible
enthusiasm, at least a dozen times on their way to
the inn; while Gammon now and then squeezed his arm,
and spoke, in an earnest tone, of the difficulties yet to be
overcome. On reaching the inn, the landlady, who was
standing at the door, and had evidently been on the look-out
for her suddenly distinguished guest, received him
with several profound courtesies, and eager and respectful
inquiries about his health, as he had had no luncheon&mdash;and
asking what he would be pleased to have for his
supper. She added, moreover, that fearing his former
bedroom might not have been to his mind, she had
changed it, and he would that night sleep in the very
best she had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must make a night on 't, eh?" quoth Mr. Quirk,
with an excited air. His partners assented to it, as did
Mr. Titmouse; and cold beef, sausages, fowl, ham, beefsteaks,
and mutton-chops, were ordered to be in readiness
in half an hour's time. Soon afterwards Mr. Titmouse
followed the chambermaid to his new bedroom.</p>

<p>"This is the room we always give to quality folk&mdash;when
we get them," said she, as she set his candle on the
drawers, and looked round the apartment with a little
triumph.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;yes!&mdash;'pon my soul&mdash;quite right&mdash;always do
your best for quality!&mdash;Lovely gal&mdash;eh?" Here he
chucked her under the chin, and seemed disposed to imprint
a kiss upon her cheek; but, with a "Lord sir&mdash;that's
not the way quality folks behave!" she modestly
withdrew. Titmouse, left alone, first threw himself on
the bed; then started off, and walked about; then sat
down; then danced about; then took off his coat; then
threw himself on the bed again; hummed, whistled, and
jumped up again&mdash;in a sort of wild ecstasy, or delirium.
In short, it was plain that he was not master of himself.
In fact, his little mind was agitated by the day's event,
like as would be a small green puddle by the road-side,
for a while, on a stone being suddenly flung into it
by a child. While Messrs. Quirk and Snap were, after
their sort, as excited as was even Mr. Titmouse himself,
Gammon, retiring to his bedroom, and ordering thither
pens, ink, and paper, sat down and wrote the following
letter:&mdash;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<div align="right">"York, 5th April, 18&mdash;.</div>
<br />

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The very first leisure moment I have, I
devote to informing you, as one of the most intimate friends
of our highly respected client, Mr. Titmouse, of the brilliant
event which has just occurred. After a most severe and protracted
struggle of two days, (the Attorney-General having
come down special on the other side,) the jury, many of them
the chief gentlemen of the county, have within this last hour
returned a verdict in favor of our friend, Mr. Titmouse&mdash;thereby
declaring him entitled to the whole of the estates at
Yatton, (ten thousand a-year rent-roll, at least,) and, by consequence,
to an immense accumulation of bygone rents, which
must be made up to him by his predecessor, who, with all his
powerful party, and in spite of the unscrupulous means resorted
to to defeat the ends of justice, is dismayed beyond
expression at the result of this grand struggle&mdash;unprecedented
in the annals of modern litigation. The result has given lively
satisfaction in these parts&mdash;it is plain that our friend Mr.
Titmouse will very soon become a great <i>lion</i> in society.</p>

<p>"To you, my dear sir, as an early and valued friend of our
interesting client, I sit down to communicate the earliest intelligence
of this most important event; and I trust that you
will, with our respectful compliments, communicate the happy
news to your amiable family&mdash;who, I am persuaded, must
ever feel a warm interest in our client's welfare. He is now,
naturally enough, much excited with his extraordinary good
fortune, to which we are only too proud and happy to have
contributed by our humble, but strenuous and long-continued
exertions. He begs me to express his cordial feelings towards
you, and to say that, on his return to town, Satin Lodge
will be one of the very first places at which he will call. In
the mean time, I beg you will believe me, my dear sir, with
the best compliments of myself and partners, yours most
sincerely,</p>

<div align="right"> "<span class="smcap">Oily Gammon.</span> </div>
<div align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;"<span class="smcap">Thomas Tag-Rag, Esq.</span> </div>
<div align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c." </div>

</blockquote>


<p>"That, I think, will about do"&mdash;quoth Gammon to
himself, with a thoughtful air, as, having made an exact
copy of the above letter, he sealed it up and directed it.
He then came down-stairs to supper, having first sent the
letter off to the post-office. What a merry meal was that
same supper! Mr. Titmouse, Mr. Quirk, and Mr. Snap,
ate almost to bursting; Gammon was more abstinent&mdash;but,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
overpowered by the importunities of his companions,
he took a far greater quantity than usual of the bouncing
bottled porter, the hard port, and fiery sherry, which his
companions drank as if they had been but water. Then
came in the spirits&mdash;with hot water and cold; and to
these all present did ample justice; in fact, it was very
hard for any one to resist the other's entreaties. Mr.
Gammon in due time felt himself <i>going</i>&mdash;but seemed as
if, on such an occasion, he had no help for it. Every one
of the partners, at different stages of the evening, made&mdash;<i>more
suo</i>&mdash;a speech to Titmouse, and proposed his
health; who, of course, replied to each, and drank the
health of each. Presently old Quirk sang a comic song,
in a very dismal key; and then he and Snap joined in a
duet called, "<i>Handcuff</i> v. <i>Halter</i>;" at which Gammon
laughed heartily, and listened with that degree of pleased
attention, which showed that he had resolved, for once
at least, to abandon himself to the low enjoyment of the
passing hour. Then Titmouse began to speak of what
he should do, as soon as he had "touched the shiners"&mdash;his
companions entering into all his little schemes with
a sort of affectionate enthusiasm. At length old Mr.
Quirk, after by turns laughing, crying, singing, and talking,
leaned back in his chair, with his half-emptied tumbler
of brandy and water in his hand, and fell fast asleep.
Gammon also, in spite of all he could do, began&mdash;the
deuce take it!&mdash;to feel and exhibit the effects of a hasty
and hearty meal, and his very unusual potations, especially
after such long abstinence and intense anxiety as
he had experienced during the previous two days. He
had intended to have seen all his companions under the
table; but he began gradually to feel a want of control
over himself, his thoughts, and feelings, which a little
disquieted him, as he now and then caught glimpses of
the extent to which it was proceeding. "<i>In vino veritas</i>,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
properly translated, means&mdash;that when a man is
fairly under the influence of liquor, you see a strong
manifestation of his real character. The vain man is
vainer; the voluble, more voluble; the morose, more
morose; the passionate, more passionate; the detractor,
more detracting; the sycophant, more sycophantic, and
so forth. Now Mr. Gammon was a cold, cautious, long-headed
schemer, and as the fumes of liquor mounted up
into his head, they did but increase the action and intensity
of those qualities for which, when sober, he was so
pre-eminently distinguished; only that there was a half-conscious
want of coherency and subordination. The
impulse and the habit were present; but there seemed
also a strange disturbing force: in short&mdash;what is the
use of disguising matters?&mdash;Mr. Gammon was getting
very drunk; and he felt very sorry for it&mdash;but it was
too late. In due time the dismal effort <i>not to appear
drunk</i>, ceased&mdash;a vast relief! Silent and more silent
he became; more and more observant of the motions of
Snap and Titmouse; more and more complicated and
profound in his schemes and purposes; and at length he
felt as if, by some incomprehensible means, he were attempting
to take <i>himself</i> in&mdash;inveigling himself: at
which point, after a vain attempt to understand his exact
position, with reference to himself, he slowly, but <i>rather</i>
unsteadily, rose from his chair; looked with an unsettled
eye at Titmouse for nearly a minute; a queer smile now
and then flitted across his features; and he presently
rang the bell. Boots having obeyed the summons, Gammon
with a turbid brain and cloudy eye followed him to
the door, with a most desperate but unavailing effort to
walk thither steadily. Having reached his room, he sat
down with a sort of suspicion that he had said or done
something to commit himself. Vain was the attempt
to wind up his watch; and at length he gave it up, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
a faint curse. With only one stocking off, conceiving
himself to be undressed, after trying four or five times
ineffectually to blow out his candle, he succeeded, and
got into bed; his head, however, occupying the place
assigned to his feet. He lay asleep for about half an
hour&mdash;and then experienced certain insupportable sensations.
He was indeed miserable beyond description;
and lost all thoughts of what would become of Titmouse&mdash;of
Quirk and Snap&mdash;in his own most desperate indisposition.</p>

<p>"I say, Snap," quoth Titmouse, with a grin, and putting
his finger to his nose, as soon as Gammon had
quitted the room in the manner above described&mdash;"Mr.
Quirk a'n't much company for us just now, eh? Shall
we go out and have some fun?"</p>

<p>"Walk will do us good&mdash;yes. Go where you like, Titmouse,"
replied Snap, who, though young, was a thoroughly
seasoned vessel, and could hold a great deal of
drink without seeming, or really being, much the worse
for it. As for Titmouse, happily for him! (seeing that
he was so soon to have the command of unlimited means,
unless indeed the envious fates should in the mean time
interpose to dash the brimful cup from his eager lips,) he
was becoming more and more accustomed to the effects
of drink; which had, up to the moment I am speaking
of, had no other effect than to elevate his spirits up to the
pitch of indefinite daring and enterprise. "'Pon my life,
Snap, couldn't we stand another tumbler&mdash;eh? Warm
us for the night air?" "What shall it be?" quoth Snap,
ringing the bell&mdash;"whiskey?"</p>

<p>"Devil knows, and devil cares!" replied Mr. Titmouse,
recklessly; and presently there stood before the friends
two steaming tumblers of what they had ordered. Immediately
after disposing of them, the two gentlemen,
quite <i>up to the mark</i>, as they expressed it&mdash;each with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
cigar in his mouth&mdash;sallied forth in quest of adventures.
Titmouse felt that he had now become a gentleman; and
his tastes and feelings prompted him to pursue, as early
as possible, a gentlemanly line of conduct&mdash;particularly
in his amusements. It was now past twelve; and the
narrow old-fashioned streets of York, silent and deserted,
formed a strong contrast to the streets of London at the
same hour, and seemed scarcely to admit of much sport.
But sport our friends were determined to have; and the
night air aiding the effect of their miscellaneous potations,
they soon became somewhat excited and violent. Yet it
seemed difficult to get up a <i>row</i>&mdash;for no one was visible
in any direction. Snap, however, by way of making a beginning,
suddenly shouted "Fire!" at the top of his voice,
and Titmouse joined him; when having heard half a dozen
windows hastily thrown up by the dismayed inhabitants
whom the alarming sounds had aroused from sleep, they
scampered off at their top speed. In another part of the
town they yelled, and whistled, and crowed like cocks,
and mewed like cats&mdash;the last two being accomplishments
in which Titmouse was very eminent&mdash;and again
took to their heels. Then they contrived to twist a few
knockers off doors, pull bells, and break a few windows;
and while exercising their skill in this last branch of the
night's amusement, Titmouse, in the very act of aiming a
stone which took effect in the middle of a bedroom window,
was surprised by an old watchman waddling round
the corner. He was a feeble asthmatic old man; so Snap
knocked him down at once, and Titmouse blew out the
candle in his lantern, which he then jumped upon and
smashed to pieces, and knocked its prostrate owner's hat
over his eyes. Snap, on some strange unaccountable impulse,
wrested the rattle out of the poor creature's hand,
and sprang it loudly. This brought several other old
watchmen from different quarters; and aged numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
prevailing against youthful spirit&mdash;the two gentlemen,
after a considerable scuffle, were overpowered and conveyed
to the cage. Snap having muttered something
about demanding to look at the <i>warrant</i>, and then about
an action for malicious arrest and false imprisonment,
sank on a form, and then down upon the floor, and fell
fast asleep. Titmouse for a while showed a very resolute
front, and swore a great many oaths, that he would fight
the Boots at the inn for five shillings, if he dared show
himself; but all of a sudden, his spirit collapsed, as it
were, and he sank on the floor, and was grievously indisposed
for some hours. About nine o'clock, the contents
of the cage&mdash;viz. Snap, Titmouse, two farmers' boys
who had been caught stealing cakes, an old beggar,
and a young pickpocket&mdash;were conveyed before the
Lord Mayor to answer for their several misdeeds. Snap
was wofully crestfallen. He had sent for the landlord of
the inn where they had put up, to come, on their behalf,
to the Mansion-house; but he told Quirk of the message
he had received. Mr. Quirk, finding that Gammon could
not leave his room through severe indisposition&mdash;the
very first time that Mr. Quirk had ever seen or heard of
his being so overtaken&mdash;set off, in a very mortified and
angry mood, in quest of his hopeful client and junior
partner. They were in a truly dismal pickle. Titmouse
pale as death, his clothes disordered, and a part of his
shirt-collar torn off; Snap sat beside him with a sheepish
air, seeming scarce able to keep his eyes open. At him
Mr. Quirk looked with keen indignation, but spoke neither
to him, nor on his behalf. For Titmouse, however, he expressed
great commiseration, and entreated his Lordship
to overlook the little misconduct of which he (Titmouse)
in a moment of extreme excitement, had been guilty, on
condition of his making amends for the injury, both to
person and property, of which he had been guilty. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
this time his Lordship had become aware of the names and
circumstances of the two delinquents; and after lecturing
them very severely, he fined them five shillings a-piece
for being drunk, and permitted them to be discharged, on
their promising never to offend in the like way again, and
paying three pounds by way of compensation to the watchman,
and one or two persons whose knockers they were
proved to have wrenched off, and windows to have broken.
His Lordship had delayed the case of Messrs. Snap and
Titmouse to the last; chiefly because, as soon as he had
found out who Mr. Titmouse was, it occurred to him that
he would make a sort of a little star, at the great ball to
be given by the Lady Mayoress that evening. As soon,
therefore, as the charge had been disposed of, his Lordship
desired Mr. Titmouse to follow him, for a moment, to his
private room. There having shut the door, he gently
chided Mr. Titmouse for the indiscretion of which he had
been guilty, and which was not to have been expected from
a gentleman of his consequence in the county. His Lordship
begged him to consider the station which he was now
called to occupy; and in alluding to the signal event of
the preceding day, warmly congratulated him upon it;
and, trusted by the way, that Mr. Titmouse would, in the
evening, favor the Lady Mayoress and himself with his
company at the ball, where they would be very proud of
the opportunity of introducing him to some of the gentry
of the county, among whom his future lot in life was likely
to be cast. Mr. Titmouse listened to all this as if he were
in a dream. His brain (the little of it that he had) was
yet in a most unsettled state; as also was his stomach.
When he heard the words "Lady Mayoress," "ball,"
"Mansion-house," "gentry of the county," and so forth,
a dim vision of splendor flashed before his eyes; and, with
a desperate effort, he assured the Lord Mayor that he
should be "very uncommon proud to accept the invitation,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
if he were well enough&mdash;but, just then, he was
uncommon ill."</p>

<p>His Lordship pressed him to take a glass of water, to
revive him and settle his stomach; but Mr. Titmouse
declined it, and soon afterwards quitted the room; and
leaning on the arm of Mr. Quirk, set off homeward&mdash;Snap
walking beside him in silence, with a very quaint disconcerted
air&mdash;not being taken the least notice of by Mr.
Quirk. As they passed along, they encountered several
of the barristers on their way to court, and others, who
recognized Titmouse; and with a smile, evidently formed
a pretty accurate guess as to the manner in which the
triumph of the preceding day had been celebrated. Mr.
Quirk, finding that Mr. Gammon was far too much indisposed
to think of quitting York, at all events till a late
hour in the evening, and, indeed, that Titmouse was similarly
situated&mdash;with a very bad grace consented to their
stopping behind; and himself, with Snap&mdash;the former
inside, the latter outside&mdash;having paid most of the witnesses,
leaving the remainder, together with their own
expenses at the inn, to be settled by Mr. Gammon&mdash;set
off for town by the two o'clock coach. It was, indeed,
high time for them to return; for the oppressed inmates
of Newgate were getting wild on account of the protracted
absence of their kind and confidential advisers. When
they left, both Gammon and Titmouse were in bed. The
former, however, began to revive, shortly after the wheels
of the coach which conveyed away his respected copartners,
and the sound of the guard's horn, had ceased to be
heard; and about an hour afterwards he descended from
his room, a great deal the better for the duties of the toilet,
and a bottle of soda-water with a little brandy in it.
A cup of strong tea, and a slice or two of dry toast, set
him entirely to rights&mdash;and then Gammon&mdash;the calm,
serene, astute Gammon&mdash;was "himself again." Had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
said anything indiscreet, or in any way committed himself,
over-night?&mdash;thought he, as he sat alone, with folded
arms, trying to recollect what had taken place. He hoped
not&mdash;but had no means of ascertaining. Then he entered
upon a long and anxious consideration of the position of
affairs, since the great event of the preceding evening.
The only definite object which he had ever had in view,
personally, in entering into the affair, was the obtaining
that ascendency over Titmouse, in the event of his becoming
possessed of the magnificent fortune they were in
quest of for him, which might enable him, in one way or
another, to elevate his own position in society, and secure
for himself permanent and solid advantages. In the progress
of the affair, however, new views presented themselves
to his mind.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the afternoon Titmouse recovered
sufficiently to make his appearance down-stairs. Soon afterwards,
Gammon proposed a walk, as the day was fine,
and the brisk fresh country air would be efficacious in restoring
Titmouse to his wonted health and spirits. His
suggestion was adopted; and soon afterwards might have
been seen, Gammon, supporting on his arm his languid
and interesting client Mr. Titmouse, making their way towards
the river; along whose quiet and pleasing banks
they walked for nearly a couple of hours in close conversation;
during which, Gammon, by repeated and various
efforts, succeeded in producing an impression on Titmouse's
mind, that the good fortune which seemed now
within his reach, had been secured for him by the enterprise,
skill, and caution of him, Mr. Gammon, only; who
would, moreover, continue to devote himself to Mr. Titmouse's
interests, and protect him from the designs of
those who would endeavor to take advantage of him. Mr.
Gammon also dropped one or two vague hints that his&mdash;Titmouse's&mdash;continuance
in the enjoyment of the Yatton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
property, would always depend upon the will and power
of him, the aforesaid Mr. Gammon; in whose hands were
most unsuspected, but potent weapons. And indeed it is
not at all impossible that such may prove to be really
the case.</p>

<p>What a difference is there between man and man, in
temper, and disposition, and intellect! Compare together
the two individuals now walking slowly, arm-in-arm, beside
the sweet Ouse; and supposing one to have designs
upon the other&mdash;disposed to ensnare and overreach him&mdash;what
chance has the shorter gentleman? Compare even
their countenances&mdash;ah me!&mdash;what a difference!</p>

<p>Gammon heard with uneasiness of Titmouse's intention
to go to the Lady Mayoress's ball that evening; and, for
many reasons, resolved that he should not. In vain, however,
did Gammon try to persuade him that he was asked
only to be turned into ridicule, for that almost everybody
there would be in the interest of the Aubreys, and bitterly
opposed to him, Mr. Titmouse; in spite of these and all
other representations, Titmouse expressed his determination
to go to the ball; on which Gammon, with a good-natured
smile, exclaimed, "Well, well!"&mdash;and withdrew
his opposition. Shortly after their return from their walk,
they sat down to dinner; and Gammon, with a cheerful air,
ordered a bottle of champagne, of which he drank about
a glass and a half, and Titmouse the remainder. That
put him into a humor to take more wine, without much
pressing; and he swallowed, in rapid succession, a glass
of ale, and seven or eight glasses of red-hot port and fiery
sherry. By this time, he had forgotten all about the ball,
and clamored for brandy and water. Gammon, however,
saw that his end was answered. Poor Titmouse was soon
reduced to a state of helplessness and insensibility; and
within half an hour's time was assisted to his bedroom
in a truly deplorable condition! Thus Gammon had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
satisfaction of seeing his benevolent design accomplished,
although it pained him to think of the temporary inconvenience
occasioned to the unconscious sufferer; who had,
however, escaped the devices of those who wished publicly
to expose his inexperience; and as for the means which
Gammon had resorted to in order to effect his purpose,&mdash;why,
he may be supposed to have had a remoter object in
view, viz. early to disgust him with intemperance.</p>

<p>Alas! how disappointed were the mayor and mayoress,
that their queer little lion did not make his appearance
in the gay and brilliant scene! How many had they told
that he was coming! Their three daughters were almost
bursting with vexation and astonishment. They had been
disposed to entertain a warmer feeling than that of mere
curiosity towards the new owner of an estate worth ten
thousand a-year&mdash;had drawn lots which of them was first
to dance with him; and had told all their friends on which
of them the lot had fallen. Then, again, many of the
county people inquired from time to time of the chagrined
little mayor and mayoress when "Mr. Ticklemouse," "Mr.
Tipmouse," "Mr. Tipplebattle," or "whatever his name
might be," was coming; full of real curiosity, much tinctured,
however, with disgust and contempt, to see the
stranger, who had suddenly acquired so commanding a
station in the county&mdash;so strong a claim to their sympathy
and respect! Then, again, there was a very great
lion there, exhibiting for a short time only, who also had
wished to see the <i>little</i> lion, and expressed keen regrets
that it was not there according to appointment. The
great lion was Mr. Quicksilver, who had stepped in for
about half an hour, merely to show himself; and when he
heard of the expected arrival of his little client, it occurred
to Mr. Quicksilver, who could see several inches beyond
by no means a short nose, that Mr. Titmouse had gained
a verdict which would very soon make him <i>patron of the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
<i>borough of Yatton</i>&mdash;that he probably would not think of
sitting for the borough himself, and that a little public
civility bestowed upon Mr. Titmouse, by the great Mr.
Quicksilver, one of the counsel to whose splendid exertions
he was indebted for his all, might be, as it were, <i>bread
thrown upon the waters, to be found after many days</i>. It
was true that Mr. Quicksilver, in a bitter stream of eloquent
invective, had repeatedly denounced the system of
close and "rotten" boroughs; but his heart, all the while,
secretly rebelled; and he knew that a snug little borough
was a thing on every account not to be sneezed at. He
sat for one himself, though he had also contested several
counties; but that was expensive and harassing work;
and the seat which he at present occupied, he had paid
far too high a price for. He had no objection to the existence
of close boroughs in the abstract; but only to so
many of them being in the hands of the opposite party;
and the legislature hath since recognized the distinction,
and acted upon it. Here, however, was the case of a borough
which was going to change hands, and pass from
Tory to Whig; and could Mr. Quicksilver fail to watch
it with interest? Was he, therefore, to neglect this opportunity
of slipping in for Yatton&mdash;and the <i>straw moving</i>,
too, in town&mdash;a general election looked for? So Mr.
Quicksilver really regretted the absence of the little lion&mdash;his
little friend and client, Mr. Titmouse.</p>

<p>Thus, and by such persons, and on such grounds, was
lamented the absence of Mr. Titmouse from the ball of
the Lady Mayoress of York; none, however, knowing the
cause which kept him from so select and distinguished an
assembly. Mr. Gammon, as soon as he had seen Mr. Titmouse
properly attended to, and had expressed an anxious
sympathy for him, set out for a walk&mdash;a quiet solitary
walk round the ancient walls of York. If on a fine night
you look up into the sky, and see it gleaming with innumerable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
stars, and then fix your eye intently, <i>without wavering</i>,
upon some one star; however vivid and brilliant
may be those in its immediate vicinity, they will disappear
utterly, and that on which your eye is fixed will
seem alone in its glory&mdash;sole star in the firmament.
Something of this kind happened to Mr. Gammon when
on the walls of York&mdash;now slowly, then rapidly walking,
now standing, then sitting; all the objects which generally
occupied his thoughts faded away, before one on
which his mind's eye was then fixed with unwavering intensity&mdash;the
image of Miss Aubrey. The golden fruit
that was on the eve of dropping into the hands of the firm&mdash;ten
thousand pounds&mdash;the indefinite and varied advantages
to himself, personally, to which their recent successes
might be turned, all vanished. What would he
not undergo, what would he not sacrifice, to secure the
favor of Miss Aubrey? Beautiful being&mdash;all innocence,
elegance, refinement:&mdash;to possess her would elevate him
in the scale of being; it would purify his feelings, it would
ennoble his nature. What was too arduous or desperate
to be undertaken in order to secure a prize so glorious as
this? He fell into a long revery, till, roused by a chill
gust of night air, he rose from his seat upon one of the
niches in the walls;&mdash;how lonely, how solitary he felt!
He walked on rapidly, at a pace that suited the heated and
rapid current of thoughts that passed through his mind.</p>

<p>"No, I have not a chance&mdash;not a chance!" at length
he thought to himself&mdash;"That girl will be prouder in
her poverty, than ever she would have been in her
wealth and splendor. Who am I?&mdash;a partner in the
firm of Quirk, Gammon, and Snap; a firm in bad odor
with the profession; looking for practice from polluted
sources, with a host of miscreants for clients&mdash;faugh!
faugh! I feel contaminated and degraded! My name
even is against me; it is growing into a by-word!&mdash;We
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
must push our advantage&mdash;they must be driven
from Yatton&mdash;he, she&mdash;all of them; yes, all." He
paused for a long time, and a sort of pang passed through
his mind. "They are to make way for&mdash;Titmouse!&mdash;for
Titmouse!! And he, too, loves her&mdash;<i>bah!</i>" He
involuntarily uttered this sound fiercely, and aloud.
"But stay&mdash;he really is in love with Miss Aubrey&mdash;that
I know;&mdash;ah! I can turn it to good purpose; it
will give me, by the way, a hold upon the little fool;
I will make him believe that through my means he may
obtain Miss Aubrey! Misery may make her accessible;
I can easily bring myself into contact with them, in their
distress; for there are the mesne profits&mdash;<i>the mesne
profits!</i> Heavens! how glorious, but how dreadful an
engine are <i>they</i>! They will help to batter down the high
wall of pride that surrounds <i>them</i> and <i>her</i>; but it will
require infinite care and tact in the use of such an engine!
I will be all delicacy&mdash;gentleness&mdash;generosity;
I will appear friendly to her, and to her brother; and, if
needs must be, why he must be <i>crushed</i>. There is no
help for it. He looks decidedly, by the way&mdash;a man of
intellect. I wonder how he bears it&mdash;how they all bear
it&mdash;how <i>she</i> bears it! <i>Beggared beauty</i>&mdash;there's something
touching in the very sound! How little they think
of the power that is at this moment in my hands!"
Here a long interval elapsed, during which his thoughts
had wandered towards more practical matters. "If they
don't get a rule <i>nisi</i>, next term, we shall be in a position
to ask them what course they intend to pursue: Gad,
they may, if so disposed, hold out for&mdash;how very cold
it is!"&mdash;he buttoned his coat&mdash;"and, what have I
been thinking of? Really I have been dreaming; or am
I as great a fool as Tittlebat?" Within a few minutes'
time he had quitted the walls, and descended through
one of the turreted gateways, into the town.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>When, about seven o'clock on the morning after the
delivery of the verdict, which, if sustained, consigned the
Aubreys to beggary, they met to partake of a slight and
hasty breakfast before setting off for Yatton, the countenances
of each bore the traces of great suffering, and
also of the efforts made to conceal it. They saluted each
other with fervent affection, each attempting a smile&mdash;but
a smile, how wan and forced! "The moment has
arrived, dear Agnes and Kate," said Mr. Aubrey, with a
fond air but a firm voice, as his sister was preparing tea,
in silence, fearful of looking at either her brother or
sister-in-law; "the moment has arrived that is to try
what stuff we are made of. If we have any strength,
this is the time to show it!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I thought of you both almost all night
long!" replied Miss Aubrey, tremulously. "You have
a lion's heart, dear Charles; and yet you are so gentle
with us"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should be a poor creature indeed, Kate, to give way
just when I ought to play the man. Come, dear Kate,
I will remind you of a noble passage from our glorious
Shakespeare. It braces one's nerves to hear it!" Then,
with a fine impressive delivery, and kindling with excitement
as he went on, Aubrey began&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>'Twas kindly meant of Aubrey; he thought to divert
the excited feelings of his wife and sister, and occupy
their imagination with the vivid imagery and noble sentiment
of the poet. While he repeated the above lines,
his sister's eye had been fixed upon him with a radiant
expression of resolution, her heart responding to what she
heard. She could not, however, speak when he had
ceased. For herself she cared not; but when she looked
at her brother, and thought of him, his wife, his children,
her fortitude yielded before the moving array, and she
burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Come, Kate&mdash;my own sweet, good Kate!" said he,
cheerfully, laying his hand upon hers, "we must keep
constant guard against our <i>feelings</i>. They will be ever
arraying before our eyes the past&mdash;the dear, delightful
past&mdash;happy and beautiful, in mournful contrast with
the present, and stirring up, every moment, a thousand
secret and tender associations, calculated to shake our
constancy. Whenever our eyes <i>do</i> turn to the past, let
it be with humble gratitude to God for having allowed
us all, in this changing world, so long an interval of happiness;
such, indeed, as falls to the lot of few. <i>What!
shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not
receive evil?</i>"</p>

<p>"My own Charles!" exclaimed Mrs. Aubrey, rising
and throwing her arms round her husband, whose countenance
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
was calm and serene, as was the tone of the sentiments
he expressed solemn and elevated. Miss Aubrey
was overcome with her stronger feelings, and buried her
face in her handkerchief. Shortly afterwards the carriage
drew up, and Dr. Tatham also made his appearance
on horseback.</p>

<p>"Good-morning! good-morning, my friends," cried he,
cheerfully, as he entered, holding forth both his hands;
"you can't think how fresh and pleasant the air is!
The country for me, at all times of the year! I hate
towns! Did you sleep well? I slept like a top all night
long;&mdash;no, I didn't either, by the way. Come, come,
ladies! On with your bonnets and shawls!" Thus rattled
on worthy little Dr. Tatham, in order to prevent
anything being said which might disturb those whom he
came to see, or cause his own highly-charged feelings to
give way. The sight of Mrs. and Miss Aubrey, however,
who greeted him in silence as they hastily drew on their
bonnets and shawls, overcame his ill-sustained gayety;
and before he could bustle back, as he presently did, to
the street door, his eyes were obstructed with tears, and
he wrung the hand of Mr. Aubrey, who stood beside him,
with convulsive energy. They soon set off, and at a
rapid pace, Dr. Tatham riding along beside the carriage.
Yatton was about twelve miles off. For the first few
miles they preserved a tolerable show of cheerfulness;
but as they perceived themselves nearing Yatton, it became
plainly more and more of an effort for any of them
to speak. Dr. Tatham, also, talked to them seldomer
through the windows. At one time he dropped considerably
behind; at another, he rode as much ahead.</p>

<p>"Oh, Charles, don't you dread to see Yatton?" said
Miss Aubrey, suddenly, as they turned a familiar corner
of the road. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Aubrey answered
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you come to the village," said Mr. Aubrey
presently, to the postilion, "drive through it, right up to
the Hall, as quickly as you can." He was obeyed. As
they passed rapidly along with their windows up, none of
the wretched party seemed disposed to look through, but
leaned back, in silence, in their seats.</p>

<p>"God bless you! God bless you! I shall call in the
evening," exclaimed Dr. Tatham; as, having reached the
vicarage, he hastily waved his hand, and turned off. Soon
they had passed the park gates; when had they entered
it before with such heavy hearts&mdash;with eyes so dreading
to encounter every familiar object that met them? Alas!
the spacious park was no longer theirs; not a tree, not
a shrub, not a flower, not an inch of ground; the trees
all putting forth their fresh green leaves&mdash;nothing was
theirs; the fine old turreted gateway, too&mdash;an object always,
hitherto, of peculiar pride and attachment, their
hearts seemed to tremble as they rattled under it!</p>

<p>"Courage, my sweet loves! Courage! courage!" exclaimed
Mr. Aubrey, grasping each of their hands, and
then they burst into tears. Mr. Aubrey felt his own fortitude
grievously shaken as he entered the old Hall, no longer
his <i>home</i>, and reflected, moreover&mdash;bitterest thought of
all&mdash;that he had been declared by the law to have been
hitherto the wrongful occupant of it; that he must forthwith
proceed to "set his house in order," and prepare for
a dreadful reckoning with him whom the law had declared
to be the true owner of Yatton.</p>

<p>The formal result of the trial at York, was, as has been
already intimated, to declare Mr. Titmouse entitled to recover
possession of only that insignificant portion of the
estates which were occupied by Jacob Jolter; and that,
too, only in the event of the first four days of the ensuing
term elapsing, without any successful attempt being made
to impeach, before the court, the propriety of the verdict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of the jury. It is a principle of our English law, that the
verdict of a jury is, in general, irreversible and conclusive;
but, inasmuch as that verdict may have been improperly
obtained&mdash;as, for instance, either through the misdirection
of the judge, or his erroneous admission or rejection
of evidence; or may have no force in point of law by reason
of the pleadings of the party for whom it has been
given, being insufficient to warrant the court to award its
final judgment upon, and in conformity with, such verdict,
or by reason of the discovery of fresh evidence subsequently
to the trial: therefore the law hath given the
party who failed at the trial, till the end of the first four
days of the term next ensuing, to show the court why the
verdict obtained by his opponent ought to go for nothing,
and matters remain as they were before the trial, or
a new trial be had. So anxious is our law to afford the
utmost scope and opportunity for ascertaining what ought
to be its decision, which, when obtained, is, as hath been
said, solemnly and permanently conclusive upon the subject;
such the effectual and practical corrective of any
error or miscarriage in the working of that noble engine&mdash;trial
by jury. Thus, then, it appears, that the hands
of Mr. Titmouse and his advisers were at all events stayed
till the first four days of Easter term should have elapsed.
During the interval thus afforded to the advisers of Mr.
Aubrey, his case, as it appeared upon the notes of his counsel
on their briefs, with the indirect assistance and corroboration
derived from the short-hand writers' notes,
underwent repeated and most anxious examination in
all its parts and bearings, by all his legal advisers. It
need hardly be said, that every point in the case favorable
to their client had been distinctly and fully raised by
the Attorney-General, assisted by his very able juniors,
Mr. Sterling and Mr. Crystal; and so was it with the
counsel of Mr. Titmouse, as, indeed, the result showed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
On subsequent examination, none of them could discover
any false step, or any advantage which had been overlooked,
or taken inefficiently. Independently of various
astute objections taken by the Attorney-General to the reception
of several important portions of the plaintiff's evidence,
the leading points relied on in favor of Mr. Aubrey
were&mdash;the impropriety of Lord Widdrington's rejection
of the deed of confirmation on account of the erasure in
it; the effect of that deed, assuming the erasure not to
have warranted its rejection; and several questions arising
out of the doctrine of adverse possession, by which alone,
it had been contended at the trial, that the claim of the
descendants of Stephen Dreddlington had been peremptorily
and finally barred. Two very long consultations had
been held at the Attorney-General's chambers, attended
by Mr. Sterling, Mr. Crystal, Mr. Mansfield, the three
partners in the firm of Runnington and Company, Mr.
Parkinson, and Mr. Aubrey&mdash;who had come up to town
specially for the purpose. Greatly to the surprise of all
of them, he stated most distinctly and emphatically, that
he insisted on no ground of objection being taken against
his opponent, except such as was strictly just, equitable,
honorable, and conscientious. Rather than defeat him on
mere technicalities&mdash;rather than avail himself of mere
positive rules of law, while the <small>RIGHT</small>, as between the consciences
of man and man, was substantially in favor of
his opponent&mdash;Mr. Aubrey declared, however absurd or
Quixotic he might be thought, that he would&mdash;if he had
them&mdash;lose fifty Yattons. <i>Fiat justitia, ruat c&#339;lum.</i>
"You mean to say, Aubrey," interrupted the Attorney-General,
mildly, after listening for some time to his friend
and client with evident interest, and admiration of his pure
and high-minded character&mdash;"that it would be unconscientious
of you to avail yourself of a fixed and beneficial
rule of law, established upon considerations of general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
equity and utility&mdash;such, for instance, as that of adverse
possession in order to retain possession, while"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, Mr. Attorney-General, if I had lent you five
hundred pounds seven or eight years ago, would you
set up the <i>statute of limitations</i> against me when I asked
for re-payment?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Aubrey," replied the Attorney-General,
with a faint flush upon his handsome and dignified features;
"but how idle all this is! One would imagine that
we were sitting in a school of casuistry! What are we
met for, in the name of common sense? For what, but
to prevent the rightful owner of property from being deprived
of it by a trumpery accidental erasure in one of
his title-deeds, which time has deprived him of the means
of accounting for?" He then, in a very kind way, but
with a dash of peremptoriness, requested that the case
might be left in their hands, and that they might be
given credit for resorting to nothing that was inconsistent
with the nicest and most fastidious sense of honor.
This observation put an end to so unprecedented an interference;
but if Mr. Aubrey supposed that it had had any
effect upon the Attorney-General, he was mistaken; for of
course that learned and eminent person secretly resolved
to avail himself of every means that he could think of,
for overturning the verdict, and securing the Aubreys in
the possession of Yatton. He at the same time earnestly
endeavored to moderate the expectations of his client, declaring
that he was by no means sanguine as to the issue;
that Lord Widdrington's rulings at <i>Nisi Prius</i> were very
formidable things&mdash;in fact, rarely assailable; and then,
again, the senior puisne judge of the court&mdash;Mr. Justice
Grayley&mdash;had been consulted by Lord Widdrington at the
trial, and concurred with him in his principal ruling, now
sought to be moved against. At the close of the second
consultation, on the night of the first day in Easter term,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
(the Attorney-General intending to move on the ensuing
morning,) after having finally gone over the case in all
its bearings, and agreed upon the exact grounds of moving&mdash;the
Attorney-General called back Mr. Runnington for
a moment, as he was walking away with Mr. Aubrey, and
whispered to him, that it would be very proper to assume
at once that the motion failed; and consider the best mode
of negotiating concerning the surrender of the bulk of the
property, and the payment of the mesne profits.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Aubrey has quite made up his mind to the
worst, Mr. Attorney-General."</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" replied the Attorney-General, with a sigh;
and about five minutes after Mr. Runnington's departure,
the Attorney-General stepped into his carriage, which had
been standing for the last hour opposite his chambers. He
drove down to the House of Commons, where he almost
immediately after delivered a long and luminous speech
on one of the most important and intricate questions that
had been discussed during the session!</p>

<p>At length arrived the morning of the second day in term.
Lord Widdrington was occupied for about a couple of hours
in "going through the bar"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> calling on counsel to
"move" in their order matters of general business, before
taking motions for new trials. About a quarter of an hour
before his Lordship had completed the round of the bar,
the Attorney-General came into court, and arranged all his
books and papers before him; Mr. Subtle sitting next to
him, intending to take a note of the grounds on which he
moved.</p>

<p>"Does any other gentleman move?" inquired Lord
Widdrington, looking over the court. He received no
answer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Attorney-General," said he; and the Attorney-General
rose&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"If your Lordship pleases," he commenced, slowly rising
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and bowing&mdash;"in a case of <span class="smcap">Doe</span> on the Demise of
<span class="smcap">Titmouse</span> against <span class="smcap">Jolter</span>, tried before your Lordship at
the last assizes for the county of York, I have humbly
to move your Lordship for <i>a rule to show cause why a nonsuit
should not be entered, or why the verdict entered for the
plaintiff should not be set aside, and a New Trial had</i>."
He proceeded to state the facts of the case with great
clearness and brevity. In like manner&mdash;with perfect
simplicity and precision&mdash;he stated the various points
arising upon the evidence, and the general grounds of law
which have been already specified; but I am so grateful
to the reader for his patience under the infliction of so
much legal detail as was contained in the last chapter of
this history, that I shall now content myself with the
above general statement of what took place before the
court. As soon as he had sat down, the judges consulted
together for a minute or two; and then&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may take a rule to show cause, Mr. Attorney-General,"
said Lord Widdrington.</p>

<p>"On all the grounds I have mentioned, my Lord?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;on all of them. They are very well worth
considering&mdash;Mr. Solicitor-General, do you move?"</p>

<p>Up rose, thereupon, the Solicitor-General.</p>

<p>"I shall discharge your rule," whispered Mr. Subtle
to the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>"I'm not excessively sanguine,"&mdash;whispered the
Attorney-General, leaning his head close to Mr. Subtle,
and with his hand before his mouth. Then his clerk
removed the battery of books which stood before him,
together with his brief; and taking another out of his
turgid red bag, the Attorney-General was soon deep in
the details of an important shipping case, in which he
was going to move when next it came to his turn.</p>

<p>Thus the court had granted a "<small>RULE NISI</small>," as it is
called, (<i>i. e.</i> it commanded a particular thing to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
done&mdash;"<i>unless</i>" sufficient "<i>cause</i>" could be thereafter shown to
the court why it should not be done,) for either entering
a nonsuit, or having a new trial. Now, had this rule been
obtained in the present day, nearly two years must have
elapsed, owing to the immense and perhaps unavoidable
arrear of business, before the other side could have been
heard in answer to it. Now, had such been the state of
business at the time when the Rule in <i>Doe</i> d. <i>Titmouse</i> v.
<i>Jolter</i> was moved for, see the practical effect of it: had
Mr. Aubrey, instead of the high-minded and conscientious
man he undoubtedly was, been a rogue, he might have
had the opportunity of getting in nearly twenty thousand
pounds, and setting off with it to spend upon the Continent,
as soon as he found that the court had decided
against him: or, if the tenants should have been served
with notice not to pay their rents to any one but Mr. Titmouse&mdash;at
all events not to Mr. Aubrey&mdash;how were Mr.
Aubrey and his family to have subsisted during this interval?&mdash;and
with the possibility that, at the end of some
two years, he might be declared to be the true owner of
Yatton, and consequently all the while entitled to those
rents, &amp;c., the non-payment of which might have entailed
upon him the most serious embarrassments! During the
same interval, poor Mr. Titmouse, heart-sick with hope deferred,
might have taken to liquor, as a solace under his
misery, and drunk himself to death before the rule was
discharged&mdash;or brought his valuable life to a more sudden
and abrupt conclusion: which affecting event would
have relieved the court from deciding several troublesome
points of law, and kept the Aubreys in possession
of the Yatton estates. Thus much for some of the incidental
effects of the law's delay! At the time, however,
concerning which I am writing, it was otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Shall I be believed when I inform the reader that within
ten or twelve days after the rule <i>nisi</i>, in the present case,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
had been moved, "cause was shown" against it, by Mr.
Subtle and Mr. Lynx, and very admirably shown against
it too. (Mr. Quicksilver, fortunately for the interests of
Mr. Titmouse, was absent, attending a great meeting
in the City, called by himself to establish a society for
the Moral and Intellectual Regeneration of Mankind on
the basis of Pure Reason.) The Attorney-General exerted
himself to the utmost in support of his rule. He felt
that the court&mdash;though scarcely at all interfering during
his address&mdash;was against him; yet he delivered, perhaps,
one of the most masterly arguments that had ever been
heard in the place where he was speaking. Mr. Sterling
and Mr. Crystal, wisely avoiding the ground so admirably
occupied by the Attorney-General, contented themselves
with strengthening those positions which appeared to
them less fortified by authorities than the others; and
then the court said they would take a day or two's time
to consider; "less on account," said Lord Widdrington,
"of the difficulty of the case, than the magnitude of
the interests which would probably be affected by their
decision."</p>

<p>"You have them dead with you, Subtle," whispered
the Attorney-General, a slight expression of chagrin stealing
over his features, as he heard the observation of Lord
Widdrington.</p>

<p>"I never doubted it," replied Mr. Subtle, with a confident
air. Every day afterwards, from the sitting to the
rising of the court, did the anxious Aubrey attend in the
King's Bench, to hear the judgment of the court delivered.
At length arrived the last day of the term.
Soon after the sitting of the court, Lord Widdrington
pronounced judgment in two or three cases; but not
seeing the Attorney-General (who was engaged before
the House of Lords) in his place, delayed giving judgment
in the case of "<i>Doe</i> v. <i>Jolter</i>." About two o'clock
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
he made his appearance; and shortly afterwards, Lord
Widdrington, after disposing of the matter then before
the court, said&mdash;"There was a case of Doe on the demise
of Titmouse against Jolter, in which, early in the term,
a rule was obtained by the Attorney-General, calling upon
the lessor of the plaintiff to show cause why"&mdash;and he
proceeded to state the rule, and then to deliver the
written unanimous judgment of the court. A clear statement
of the facts out of which the questions submitted
to the court had arisen, and of those questions themselves,
was listened to by Mr. Aubrey in breathless suspense,
before he could obtain the faintest intimation of
the judgment which the court was about to pronounce.
Lord Widdrington went on to dispose, one by one, with
painful deliberation and precision, of the several points
presented for the decision of the court. One or two were
decided in favor of the defendant; but his Lordship added,
that it had become unnecessary to do so, in consequence of
the answers given by the witnesses to subsequent questions
at the trial, and which disposed of the doubts arising
on the former ones. The documentary evidence, subsequently
put in, got rid of another difficulty in the early
part of the plaintiff's case, and rendered immaterial a
question put by the plaintiff's counsel, and strenuously
objected to on the part of the defendant, and which the
court was of opinion, as had been Lord Widdrington at
the trial, ought not to have been allowed. Then, as to
the <span class="smcap">Adverse Possession</span>, on which very great stress had
been laid by the defendant's counsel, the court was of
opinion that none existed; since there had been a <i>disability</i>&mdash;indeed,
a series of disabilities,<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;through infancy,
coverture, and absence beyond seas, of the various
parties through whom the lessor of the plaintiff claimed.
Finally, as to the question concerning the <small>ERASURE</small>, the
court was of opinion, that the deed in which it occurred
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
had been properly rejected; inasmuch as the erasure was
in a clearly material part of the deed, and there were no
recitals in the deed by which it could be helped. That it
was incumbent upon those proffering the deed in evidence,
to account for its altered appearance, although
the deed was more than thirty years old, and rebut the
presumption of fraud arising therefrom. That the erasure
was a clear badge of fraud; and to hold otherwise, would
be to open a wide door to frauds of the most extensive
and serious description. That there had been no evidence
offered to show that the deed had ever been a valid
deed; the very first step failed; and, in short, in its then
state, it was in contemplation of law <i>no deed at all</i>; and,
consequently, had been properly rejected. "For all these
reasons, therefore," concluded Lord Widdrington, "we are
clearly of opinion, that the verdict ought not to be disturbed,
and the rule will consequently be <small>DISCHARGED</small>."<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> As these
last words were pronounced, a mist seemed for a moment
to intervene between Mr. Aubrey and everything around
him; for his thoughts had reverted to Yatton, and the
precious objects of his affection who were there, in sickening
suspense, awaiting the event which had that moment
taken place. The words yet sounding in his excited
ears, seemed like the sentence of expulsion from Paradise
passed upon our dismayed and heart-broken first parents.
Yes, in that solemn region of matter-of-fact and common-place&mdash;that
<i>dead sea</i>&mdash;generally speaking&mdash;as far as
feeling, sentiment, incident, or excitement is concerned,
the Court of King's Bench&mdash;there sat a man of exquisite
sensibility&mdash;pure and high-minded&mdash;whose feelings
were for a while paralyzed by the words which had fallen
from the judgment-seat, uttered with a cold, business-like,
indifferent air&mdash;oh! how horridly out of concert
with the anxious and excited tone of him whom, with
his lovely family, they consigned, in fact, to destitution!
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
After remaining for about a quarter of an hour, during
which brief interval he resumed the control over his feelings
which he had so long and successfully struggled to
maintain, he rose, and quitted the court. It was a heavy
lowering afternoon&mdash;one which seemed to harmonize
with the gloomy and desolate mood in which he slowly
walked homeward. He encountered many of his friends,
on foot, on horseback, and in carriages, on their way
down to the Houses of Parliament; the very sight of
them, in the morbid state of his feelings, gave him a pang
that was indescribable. With <i>them</i> matters were the
same as they had ever been&mdash;as they had till then
been with him&mdash;and as probably they would be with
them to the end of their career; but <i>he</i> had been forced,
suddenly and forever, to quit the scene of high excitement
and proud aspirations!&mdash;He heaved many deep
sighs, as he exchanged nod after nod with those he met,
as he approached Charing Cross. There he encountered
Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, the brilliant Foreign Secretary, arm-in-arm
with two eloquent and leading members of the Government&mdash;all
of them evidently in high spirits, on their
way down to the House.</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;Aubrey!&mdash;In town?&mdash;An age since we
met!"&mdash;exclaimed they, in a breath, shaking him cordially
by the hand.&mdash;"You know, of course, that the
budget comes on to-night&mdash;eh?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was not aware of it,"&mdash;said Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"I assure you," interrupted Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, "our friends
will do us great service&mdash;very essential service, by being
early in their attendance!&mdash;You know that Mr. Quicksilver
intends to come out against us to-night in great
force?&mdash;My dear Aubrey, you are going the wrong
way!"</p>

<p>"I am not going down to the House to-night!"</p>

<p>"Not going down?&mdash;Eh?&mdash;My dear Aubrey, you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
astonish me!&mdash;Have you paired off? You can't think
how I lament your absence!"</p>

<p>"I am returning to Yorkshire almost immediately."</p>

<p>"But surely you can come for an hour, or so, to-night&mdash;eh?
Come! The division won't come on till late.
Don't let a trifle stand in the way!"</p>

<p>"I would <i>not</i> let a trifle stand in the way," replied Mr.
Aubrey, in a tone and manner which at once arrested the
attention of those whom he was addressing, and suddenly
reminded them of what, in their political eagerness, they
had for a moment lost sight of&mdash;namely, the perilous
position of his private affairs.</p>

<p>"My dear Aubrey, I beg a thousand pardons for intruding
such matters upon you," said Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, with sudden
earnestness; "but shall we have an opportunity of
meeting before you leave town?"</p>

<p>"I fear&mdash;<i>not</i>;&mdash;I set off by the mail to-morrow evening&mdash;and
have in the mean time much to attend to," said
Mr. Aubrey, unable to repress a sigh&mdash;and they parted.
But for a determination not to yield to a morbid sensibility,
he would have got into a hackney-coach, and so
have avoided the "troops of friends," the hosts of "old
familiar faces," all wending down to the scene in which
he had begun so eminently to distinguish himself&mdash;but
from which he seemed now to be forever excluded. He,
therefore, pursued his way on foot. One of those on
whom his troubled eye lit, was a well-known figure on
horseback&mdash;the great Duke of &mdash;&mdash;, on his way down to
the House of Lords, going very slowly, his head inclined
on one side, his iron-cast features overspread with an expression
of stern thoughtfulness. He did not observe Mr.
Aubrey&mdash;in fact, he seemed too much absorbed with his
own thoughts to observe or recognize anybody; yet he
now and then mechanically raised his finger to his hat, in
acknowledgment of the obeisances of those who saluted
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
him as he passed. Poor Aubrey sighed; and felt as if
circumstances had placed him at an immeasurable distance
from the man whom, so lately, he had entertained
familiarly at dinner; that there seemed suddenly to exist,
as it were, a great and impassable gulf between them.</p>

<p>On reaching his house in Grosvenor Street, his heart
fluttered while he knocked and rang; and he seemed to
himself to shrink from the accustomed obsequious voice
and manner of the powdered menial who admitted him.
Having ordered a slight dinner, he repaired to his library.
The only letter which had arrived since he had left in the
morning, bore the Grilston postmark, and was in the handwriting
of Mrs. Aubrey. He opened it with trembling
eagerness. It was crossed&mdash;the dear familiar handwriting!&mdash;from
beginning to end, and full of heart-subduing
tenderness. Then it had a little enclosure, with a strange,
straggling superscription, "To my Papa;" and, on opening
it, he read, in similar characters&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"My dear Papa, I love you very very much. Do come home.
Mamma sends her love. Your dutiful son,</p>

<div align="right"> "<span class="smcap">Charles Aubrey</span>. </div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"P. S.&mdash;Agnes sends her love; she cannot write because
she is so little. Please to come home directly.</p>

<div align="right"> "<span class="smcap">Charles A., Yatton.</span>" </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Aubrey saw how it was&mdash;that Mrs. Aubrey had either
affected to write in her little son's name, or had actually
guided his pen. On the outside she had written in
pencil&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Charles says, he hopes that you will answer his letter
directly."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aubrey's lip quivered, and his eyes filled with tears.
Putting the letters into his bosom, he rose and walked to
and fro, with feelings which cannot be described. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
evening was very gloomy. Rain poured down incessantly.
He was the only person in that spacious and elegant house,
except the servants left in charge of it; and dreary and
desolate enough it appeared. He was but its nominal
owner&mdash;their nominal master! In order to save the
post, he sat down to write home&mdash;(<i>home</i>! his heart sank
within him at the thought)&mdash;and informed Mrs. Aubrey
and his sister of the event for which his previous letters
had prepared them; adding that he should set off for
Yatton by the mail of the ensuing night, and that he was
perfectly well. He also wrote a line or two, in large
printed characters, by way of answer to his little correspondent,
his son, towards whom&mdash;ah!&mdash;how his heart
yearned! and having despatched his packet, probably the
last he should ever frank, he partook of a hasty and slight
dinner, and then resigned himself to deep meditation upon
his critical circumstances. He was perfectly aware of his
precise position, in point of law, namely, that he was safe
in the possession of the Yatton property, (with the exception
of the trifle which was occupied by Jolter, and had
been the object of the action just determined,) till another
action should have been brought, directly seeking its recovery;
and that by forcing his opponent to bring such
action, he might put him to considerable risk of retaining
his verdict, and thereby greatly harass him, and ward off,
indefinitely, the evil day from himself. By these means
he might secure time, possibly also, favorable terms for
the payment of the dreadful arrear of mesne profits, in
which he stood indebted to his successor. To this effect
he had received several intimations from Mr. Runnington,
as upright and conscientious an adviser as was to be found
in the profession. But Mr. Aubrey had decided upon his
course; he had taken his ground, and intended to maintain
it. However sudden and unlooked-for had been the
claim set up against him, it had been deliberately and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
solemnly confirmed by the law of the land; and he had
no idea but of yielding to it a prompt and hearty obedience.
He resolved, therefore, to waste no time&mdash;to fritter
away no energy in feeble dalliance with trouble; but to
face her boldly. He determined to instruct Mr. Runnington,
on the morrow, to write to his opponent's solicitors,
informing them that within three weeks' time, the estates
at Yatton would be delivered up to their client, Mr. Titmouse,
and also to arrange for the quickest possible disposal
of his house in Grosvenor Street, and his wines and
his furniture, both there and at Yatton. He resolved,
moreover, to take forthwith the necessary steps for vacating
his seat in Parliament, by applying for the Stewardship
of the Chiltern Hundreds; and having determined
on these arrangements, consequent upon the adverse
decision of the Court of King's Bench of that day, he
experienced the momentary relief and satisfaction of the
seaman who has completely prepared his vessel for the
approaching storm. He felt, indeed, relieved, for a while,
from a dreadful pressure.</p>

<p>"And what, now, have I really to complain of?" said
he to himself; "why murmur presumptuously and vainly
against the dispensations of Providence? I thank God
that I am still able to recognize His hand in what has
befallen me, and to believe that <i>He hath done all things
well</i>; that prosperity and adversity are equally, from Him,
means of accomplishing <i>His</i> all-wise purposes! Is it for
<i>me</i>, poor insect! to question the goodness, the wisdom, or
the justice of my Maker? I thank God for the firm belief
I have, that <i>He governs the world in righteousness</i>, and that
He has declared that He will protect and bless those who
sincerely endeavor to discover, and conform to His will
concerning them. He it was who placed me in my late
condition of prosperity and eminence; why should I fret,
when He sees fit gently to remove me from it, and place
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
me in a different sphere of exertion and suffering? If the
dark heathen could spend a life in endeavoring to steel
his heart against the sense of suffering, and to look with
cheerless indifference upon the vicissitudes of life, shall
I, a Christian, shrink with impatience and terror from
the first glimpse of adversity? Even at the worst, how
favored is my situation in comparison of that of millions
of my fellow-creatures? Shall I&mdash;may I not&mdash;lessen
my own sufferings, by the contemplation of those which
the Almighty has thought fit to inflict upon my brethren?
What if I, and those whom I love, were the subjects of
direful disease&mdash;of vice&mdash;of dishonor? What if I were
the object of the just and universal contempt of mankind;
given up to a reprobate mind; miserable here, and without
hope hereafter? Here have I health, a loving family&mdash;have
had the inestimable advantages of education, and
even now, in the imminent approach of danger, am enabled
to preserve, in some measure, a composure of feeling,
a resolution&mdash;which will support me, and those who
are dearer to me than life." Here his heart beat quickly,
and he walked rapidly to and fro. "I am confident that
Providence will care for them! As for me, even in sight
of the more serious and startling peril which menaces me&mdash;what
is it to a Christian but a trial of his constancy?
<i>There hath no temptation taken you</i>, say the Scriptures
written for our instruction, <i>but such as is common to man</i>;<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
<i>but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted
above what ye are able, but will with the temptation, also
make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it</i>." This
consolatory passage led Aubrey, in a calm and exalted
mood of mind, to meditate upon that picture of submission
to manifold misfortune, simple and sublime beyond
all comparison or approach, drawn by the pencil of one
inspired with wisdom from on high&mdash;calculated at once
to solemnize, to strengthen, and elevate the heart and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
character of man; and which is to be found in the first
and second chapters of the <i>Book of Job</i>. Oh reader! who,
brilliant as may be at this moment your position in life,
may have been heretofore, or may be hereafter, placed in
circumstances of dreadful suffering and peril, suffer him
whose humble labors now for a moment occupy your attention,
reverently to refer you again and yet again, to
that memorable passage of holy writ! With danger surrounding
him, with utter ruin staring him in the face,
Mr. Aubrey read this passage of Scripture; his shaken
spirit gathered from it calmness and consolation; and
after a while, retiring early to bed, he enjoyed a night of
tranquil repose.</p>

<p>"These wretches are determined not to let the grass
grow underneath their feet, Mr. Aubrey," said Mr. Runnington,
who, the next morning, made his appearance at
breakfast, pursuant to appointment; "within two hours'
time of the court's delivering judgment, yesterday afternoon,
I received the following communication." He
handed to Mr. Aubrey this letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div align="right"> "<i>Saffron Hill, 25th April 18&mdash;.</i> </div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:</p>

<div align="center"> "<i>Doe</i> d. <i>Titmouse</i> v. <i>Jolter</i>. </div>
<br />

<p>"The rule for a new trial herein having been this day discharged,
and the unanimous judgment of the court delivered
in favor of the claims to the Yatton estate, of the lessor of the
plaintiff, in the present action, we shall feel obliged by an intimation
from you, at your earliest possible convenience, of the
course which your client may think fit to adopt. You are, of
course, aware that we are now in a situation to attack, successfully,
the entire property at Yatton, at present in the possession
of Mr. Aubrey; and that, had we thought fit, we might
have sought and recovered it all in the action which has just
been decided in favor of our client. It is now in our power
greatly to <i>strengthen</i> the evidence adduced at the late trial:
and we beg to be informed whether it is your client's intention
to put Mr. Titmouse to the enormous expense, and delay, of a
second trial, the issue of which cannot be doubtful; or, with
the promptitude and candor which are to be expected from a
gentleman of the station and character of your client, at once
to yield to our client the substantial fruits of his verdict.</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>

<blockquote>
<p>"If his reasonable wishes and expectations in this matter
should be disregarded and frustrated, we would merely intimate
that it will be for your client most seriously to weigh the
consequences; to see whether such a line of conduct may not
greatly prejudice his interests, and place him in a far worse
position than, perhaps, he would otherwise have occupied. As
we understand your client to be in town, we trust you will
forgive us for requesting you immediately to communicate
with him; and that at your earliest convenience you will enable
us to announce the result to our client.&mdash;We are, gentlemen,
your obedient servants,</p>


<div align="right"> "<span class="smcap">Quirk, Gammon, &amp; Snap</span>. </div>

  "<span class="smcap">Messrs. Runnington &amp; Co.</span>"
</blockquote>

<p>"Well&mdash;I own I see nothing to find fault with," said
Mr. Aubrey, calmly, but with a suppressed sigh, as soon
as he had read the letter.</p>

<p>"Rather quick work, too&mdash;is it not, Mr. Aubrey?&mdash;within
an hour or two after judgment pronounced in their
favor:&mdash;but, to be sure, it's very excusable, when you
consider the line of business and the sort of clients that
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap are accustomed to."</p>

<p>"I have made up my mind as to the course I shall
adopt," said Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, that is quite clear!" said Mr. Runnington,
pouring out his coffee&mdash;"we shall stand another
shot, and see if they've ammunition enough left for the
purpose: and we'll tender a bill of exceptions, and carry
the case into the Exchequer Chamber, and thence into
the House of Lords&mdash;ah! we'll <i>work</i> them, I warrant
them!"&mdash;and he rubbed his hands, with a little excitement
in his manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Runnington," answered Mr. Aubrey, gravely,
"would it not be wanton&mdash;most unconscientious&mdash;in
me to put them to the expense and anxiety of a second
trial, when the whole case, on both sides, has been fairly
brought before both the court and the jury?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Mr. Aubrey!" exclaimed Mr. Runnington,
with visible amazement&mdash;"who ever heard of
an estate of even one or two hundred a-year being surrendered
after one assault?"</p>

<p>"If it were ten thousand times ten thousand a-year,
I would submit&mdash;after such a trial as ours!" said
Mr. Aubrey, calmly.</p>

<p>"How do we know what fraud and perjury may have
been resorted to in order to secure the late verdict, and
which we may have the means of exploding against the
next trial? Ah, Mr. Aubrey, you don't know the character
of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap in the profession;
they learn a fresh trick from every scoundrel,
swindler, and thief, whose case they undertake."</p>

<p>"I thought that fraud and perjury were never to be
presumed, Mr. Runnington! Besides, had we not the advantage
of most eminent, acute, and experienced counsel?
How could it escape <i>them</i>?"</p>

<p>"I would only venture to remind you," said Mr. Runnington,
firmly but respectfully, "of the observations of
the Attorney-General, at our last consultation."</p>

<p>"I thought I was unanswered, Mr. Runnington, though
I did not feel at liberty to press the matter," replied Mr.
Aubrey, with a melancholy smile.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but we <i>must</i> take the chance of a second
trial," said Mr. Runnington.</p>

<p>"I have decided upon the course I shall adopt," replied
Mr. Aubrey, calmly and determinedly&mdash;"I beg
you, Mr. Runnington, to write this day to the gentlemen
upon the other side, and inform them that within three
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
weeks I shall be prepared to deliver up possession of
Yatton."</p>

<p>"My dear sir!&mdash;Do I hear aright?" exclaimed Mr.
Runnington, with some agitation. "Deliver up possession
of the estates? and within three weeks? My ears
are deceiving me!"</p>

<p>"That was what I said&mdash;or meant to say&mdash;Mr. Runnington,"
replied Mr. Aubrey, rather peremptorily.</p>

<p>"I give you my honor, Mr. Aubrey, that in the whole
course of my practice I never heard of such a procedure!"
said Mr. Runnington, with a half-desperate air.</p>

<p>"And I shall further request you to state that the last
quarter's rents are in my banker's hands, and will be paid
over to the order of Mr. Titmouse"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Mr. Aubrey!" interrupted Mr. Runnington,
with an air of deep concern.</p>

<p>"I have well considered the position in which I am
placed," said Mr. Aubrey, with a serious air.</p>

<p>"It is very painful for me to mention the subject, Mr.
Aubrey; but have you adverted to the <i>mesne</i> profits?"</p>

<p>"I have. It is, indeed, a very fearful matter: and I
frankly own that I see no way open before me, but to
trust to the forbearance of"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Forbearance!&mdash;The <i>forbearance</i> of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap!! or of any one counselled by them!"</p>

<p>"Why, what can I do? I might as well undertake to
pay off the national debt as the sum of sixty thousand
pounds!"</p>

<p>"That's just the very thing," replied Mr. Runnington,
with a dismayed air.</p>

<p>"Whatever honorable negotiation can effect, I leave it
in your hands to do. With reference to the time which
may be allowed for liquidating this frightful demand"&mdash;Mr.
Aubrey changed color, but spoke with firmness&mdash;"I
must own this to be a matter which has occasioned
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
me inexpressible anxiety, Mr. Runnington. I really do
not see what length of time will enable me to discharge
so vast a sum of money, or even to make any sensible
impression upon it. I am quite at the mercy of my enemies!"
Here both were silent for some time.</p>

<p>"At one time, I fancied that in a case so grievously
hard as yours," said Mr. Runnington, with a sigh&mdash;"you
might obtain relief from a Court of Equity from the payment
of the mesne profits, on the ground of your total
ignorance of the title of Titmouse; and I laid a case before
the most skilful lawyer in the Court of Chancery&mdash;but
alas! the answer was in the negative&mdash;that the
court had no power whatever to deprive a man of what
he had proved to be his strict legal rights"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nor can I, Mr. Runnington, see on what principle
such an interference could be supported!<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Besides&mdash;can
I <i>entirely</i> acquit myself of negligence? Have I not been
culpably forgetful of the suggestions which you made to
me at the time of my marriage settlement? No, no! I
feel myself bound hand and foot"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At this moment a thundering appeal to the knocker of
the door announced an arrival; and presently the servant
entered and stated that Lord C&mdash;&mdash; had called, and was
waiting in the library. After repeating two or three
directions to Mr. Runnington, Mr. Aubrey left him; and
presently entered the library, where Lord C&mdash;&mdash; was
waiting to receive him. Lord C&mdash;&mdash; was a middle-aged
man, tall, of elegant person, with a very handsome and
intellectual countenance, and most winning address; he
was a thorough politician, and possessed of eloquence,
immense practical knowledge, and a commanding intellect.
He was made for eminent office; and got through
the most complicated and harassing business with ease
and celerity. He had for several years entertained a
sincere regard for Mr. Aubrey, whom he considered to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
be a very rising man in the House of Commons, and to
have rendered him, on several occasions, special service
in debate. He had been much shocked to hear of the
sudden misfortune which had befallen Mr. Aubrey; and
had now come to him with a sincere desire to be of service;
and also, not without a faint hope of prevailing
upon him to come down that evening, and support them
in a very close division. He was as kind-hearted a man
as&mdash;a keen politician <i>could</i> be.</p>

<p>"I am really shocked beyond expression to hear all
this," said he, after Aubrey had, at his earnest request,
explained the position in which he was placed; the
dreadful loss he had sustained, the still more dreadful
liabilities to which he was subject. "Really," exclaimed
his Lordship, "who can be safe? It might have happened
to me&mdash;to any of us! Forgive me, my dear Aubrey,"
he continued earnestly, "if I venture to express a hope
that at all events Mrs. Aubrey and your family are provided
for, and your very lovely sister; they, I trust, are
out of the reach of inconvenience?" Mr. Aubrey's lips
quivered, and he remained silent.</p>

<p>"Allow me a friend's freedom, Aubrey, and let me
repeat my question; are your family provided for?"</p>

<p>"I will be frank, Lord C&mdash;&mdash;," replied Mr. Aubrey,
with a strong effort to preserve his composure. "The
little provision which had been made for them, is lost,
with Yatton; but for them&mdash;my wife, my children, my
sister&mdash;I could have submitted to this misfortune with
unshrinking fortitude; but they are, alas, involved in
my ruin! My wife had nothing when I married her;
and of course the settlements I made on her were out of
the Yatton property; as also was the little income left
my sister by my father. With Yatton all is gone&mdash;that
is the plain fact; and there is no disguising it."</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash; seemed much moved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Duke of &mdash;&mdash;, I, and two or three other of your
friends, were talking about these matters last night; we
wish we could serve you. What is the sort of foreign
service you would prefer, Aubrey?"</p>

<p>"<i>Foreign</i> service?" echoed Mr. Aubrey, significantly.</p>

<p>"Yes; an entire change of scene would be highly serviceable
in diverting your thoughts from the distressing
subjects which here occupy them, and must continue to
occupy them for some time to come. Can there be a
doubt of it?"</p>

<p>"It is very kindly meant, Lord C&mdash;&mdash;; but do you
really think I can for a single moment entertain the
idea of quitting the country to escape from pecuniary
liability?"</p>

<p>"That's the point, exactly; I decidedly think you
ought to do so; that you <i>must</i>," replied Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, in a
matter-of-fact manner.</p>

<p>"Nothing upon earth shall induce me to do so," replied
Mr. Aubrey, firmly. "The bare idea shocks me.
It would be the meanest, most unprincipled conduct&mdash;it
would reflect disgrace on the king's service."</p>

<p>"Poh&mdash;this is mere eccentricity&mdash;knight-errantry;
I'm sure that when you are in a calmer mood you will
think differently. Upon my honor, I never heard of such
absurdity as yours, in my life. Are you to stay at home,
to have your hands tied behind your back, and be thrust
into prison&mdash;to court destruction for yourself and your
family?" Mr. Aubrey turned aside his head, and remained
silent.</p>

<p>"I must plead in favor of Mrs. Aubrey&mdash;your children&mdash;your
sweet lovely sister;&mdash;good God! it's quite
shocking to think of what you are bringing them to."</p>

<p>"You torture my feelings, Lord C&mdash;&mdash;," said Mr.
Aubrey, tremulously and very pale; "but you do not
convince my judgment. Every dictate of conscience and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
honor combines to assure me that I should not listen to
your proposal."</p>

<p>"Good God! what an outrage on common sense!&mdash;But
has anything been yet said on the subject of these
liabilities&mdash;these <i>mesne</i> profits, as I think you said they
are called?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; but they follow as a matter of course."</p>

<p>"How is it that you owe <i>only</i> sixty thousand pounds,
Aubrey?"</p>

<p>"<i>Only</i> sixty thousand!" echoed Mr. Aubrey, amazedly.</p>

<p>"At the rate of ten thousand a-year, you must have
had at least a hundred thousand pounds of the money
belonging to your successor"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"The statute of limitations prevents more than six
years' arrears being recoverable."</p>

<p>"But do you intend, Aubrey, to avail yourself of such
a protection against the just claims of this poor, unfortunate,
ill-used gentleman? Are not the remaining forty
thousand pounds justly due&mdash;money of his which you
have been making away with? Will you let a mere technical
rule of law outweigh the dictates of honor and
conscience?"</p>

<p>"I really don't exactly understand your drift, Lord
C&mdash;&mdash;," said Mr. Aubrey, coloring visibly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I will explain. Your sovereign has a right
to command your services; and, by obeying him and
serving your country, you are enabled to prevent a malignant
opponent from ruining you and your family, by
extorting a vast sum of money not equitably due: I protest
I see no difference in principle, Aubrey, between
availing yourself of the statute of limitations, and of the
call of the king to foreign service;&mdash;but we must talk
of this again. By the way, what is the name of your
worthy opponent? Tittlemouse, or some such strange
name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Titmouse!&mdash;By the way, you lose a seat for Yatton,"
said Aubrey, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>Lord C&mdash;&mdash; pricked up his ears. "Ay, ay! how's
that?"</p>

<p>"The gentleman whom you have named professes, I
understand, Liberal principles; probably he will sit for
the borough himself; at all events, he will return the
member."</p>

<p>"He's a poor ignorant creature, isn't he? What has
made him take up with Liberal principles? By taking
a little notice of him early, one might&mdash;eh?&mdash;influence
him;&mdash;but&mdash;of course you don't intend to vacate this
session?"</p>

<p>"I intend this day to apply for the Chiltern Hundreds;
and this evening, if you like, a new writ may be moved
for the borough of Yatton."</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> come down to-night, my dear Aubrey, you
really must," said Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, with undisguised anxiety&mdash;with
more than he had shown during the interview.
"The numbers will run very close; they are
stirring heaven and earth!&mdash;Good heavens! my dear
Aubrey, a vote's invaluable to-night;&mdash;gad, you <i>sha'n't</i>
have the Chiltern Hundreds;<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> you mustn't really apply
for it&mdash;at all events, not till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I shall sit no more in the House of Commons," said
Mr. Aubrey, with a sad determined air; "besides, I leave
for Yatton by to-night's mail. There are those waiting
for me whom you would not have me disappoint, Lord
C&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Not for worlds, my dear Aubrey," replied Lord C&mdash;&mdash;,
half absently. He was intensely disappointed at not
obtaining Mr. Aubrey's vote that evening; and rose
to go.</p>

<p>"Then I am to direct to Yatton, when I may have occasion
to write to you?" said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"For the next three weeks only&mdash;my movements after
that period are not yet fixed."</p>

<p>"Adieu, Aubrey; and I entreat of you to remember
me most sincerely to Mrs. Aubrey and your sister; and
when you look at them,&mdash;recollect&mdash;pray, recollect our
conversation of to-day."</p>

<p>With this Lord C&mdash;&mdash; took his departure, and left poor
Aubrey much depressed. He quickly, however, roused
himself, and occupied the principal part of the day in
making the necessary and melancholy arrangements for
breaking up his establishment in Grosvenor Street, and
disposing of his wines, books, and furniture at Yatton.
He also instructed a house-agent to look out for two or
three respectable but small houses in the outskirts of
town, out of which might be chosen the one appearing
most suitable to himself and Mrs. Aubrey, on their arrival
in London. About eight o'clock he got into the York
mail, and his heart was heavy within him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>The result of a very long consultation between Mr. Runnington
and his partners, held on the day after his last
interview with Mr. Aubrey, was, that he drew up the following
draft of a letter, addressed to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div align="right"> "<i>Lincoln's Inn, 26th April 18&mdash;.</i> </div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:</p>

<div align="center"> "<i>Doe</i> d. <i>Titmouse</i> v. <i>Jolter</i>. </div>
<br />

<p>"In answer to your letter of yesterday, (the 25th inst.,) we
beg to inform you, that after the judgment in this cause pronounced
yesterday in the Court of King's Bench, our client,
Mr. Aubrey, does not intend to resist the claim of Mr. Titmouse
to the residue of the Yatton property. We now, therefore,
beg to give you notice, that on the 17th of next month
you will be at liberty, on behalf of your client, Mr. Titmouse,
to take possession of all the property at Yatton, at present in
the possession of Mr. Aubrey. The whole of the last quarter's
rents, due at Ladyday, have been paid into the bank of Messrs.
Harley at Grilston, and will, on the day above mentioned, be
placed at the disposal of your client.</p>

<p>"We are also instructed to request the delivery of your bill
at as early a period as may suit your convenience, with a view
to its immediate examination and settlement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We cannot forbear adding, while thus implicitly following
the instructions of our client, our very great surprise and regret
at the course which he has thought fit to adopt; since we have
the strongest reasons for believing, that had he been disposed
to contest your client's claim farther, in accordance with advice
received from a high quarter, his case would have been
materially strengthened, and your difficulties greatly increased,
and rendered, in fact, absolutely insuperable. We feel confident
that the magnanimity displayed by our client, will be
duly appreciated by <i>yours</i>.</p>

<div align="center"> "We are, Gentlemen, your obedient servants, </div>

<div align="right"> "<span class="smcap">Runnington &amp; Co</span>. </div>

<div align="left"> "<span class="smcap">Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, &amp; Snap.</span>" </div>
</blockquote>

<p>"Really," said Mr. Runnington, when he had read over
the above to his partners, "I <i>must</i> throw in a word or two
about those accursed mesne profits&mdash;yet it's a very ticklish
subject, especially with such people as these&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>One partner shook his head, and the other looked very
thoughtful.</p>

<p>"We must not compromise Mr. Aubrey," said the former
of the two.</p>

<p>"We have had no instructions on that point," said
the latter,&mdash;"on the contrary, you told us yourself that
your instructions were to announce an unconditional
surrender."</p>

<p>"That may be; but in so desperate a business as this,
I do think we have a discretion to exercise on behalf of
himself and family, which I must say, he seems quite incapable
of exercising himself. Nay, upon my honor, I
think we are <i>bound</i> not to forego the slightest opportunity
of securing an advantage for our client in this unrighteous
claim!"</p>

<p>His partners seemed struck with his observation; and
Mr. Runnington, after a few moments' consideration,
added the following postscript:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"P. S.&mdash;As to the <i>mesne profits</i>, by the way, of course we
anticipate no difficulty in effecting an amicable arrangement satisfactory
to both parties, due consideration being had for the
critical position in which our client finds himself placed so suddenly
and unexpectedly. Indeed, it is not difficult to conceive
that Mr. Aubrey, in taking the step of which we have above
advised you, must have contemplated"&mdash;&mdash;(here Mr. Runnington
paused for a considerable time,) "being met in a similar
frank, liberal, and equitable spirit."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>It was agreed, at length, that the whole amount and
effect of the above postscript ought to be regarded as a
spontaneous suggestion of Messrs. Runnington, not in any
way implicating, or calculated in any event to annoy, Mr.
Aubrey; and a fair copy of the letter and postscript having
been made, it was signed by the head of the firm, and
forthwith despatched to Saffron Hill.</p>

<p>"Struck, by Jove, Gammon!" exclaimed Mr. Quirk,
as, with the above letter open in his hands, he hurried,
the instant after he had read it, into the room of his wily
partner, and threw it down exultingly before him. Gammon
read it with apparent calmness, but a slight flush
overspread his cheek; and, as he finished the perusal, a
subdued smile of excitement and triumph stole over his
acute and placid countenance.</p>

<p>"Lord, Gammon! isn't it glorious?" quoth Mr. Quirk,
heatedly, rubbing his hands together; "give us your hand,
friend Gammon! We've fought a precious hard battle
together"&mdash;and he shook his partner's hand with vehement
cordiality. "This fellow Aubrey is a trump&mdash;isn't
he?&mdash;Egad, if I'd been in his shoes&mdash;one way or another,
I'd have stuck at Yatton for a dozen years to come&mdash;ah,
ha!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure you would&mdash;if you had been able,"
replied Gammon, dryly, and with a smile&mdash;the real character
of which was not perceived by Mr. Quirk.</p>

<p>"Ay, that I would," replied he, with a triumphant
chuckle&mdash;"but now to come to business. By next
quarter-day Titmouse will have £5,000 in hard cash&mdash;half
of it on the 17th of next month.&mdash;Lord! what
have we done for him!" he added with a sort of sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"We've put an ape into possession of Paradise&mdash;that's
all"&mdash;said Gammon, absently and half aloud, and bitterly
and contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Humph!&mdash;what of that?" said Mr. Quirk&mdash;"It answers
<i>our</i> purposes, at any rate! By the way, Gammon,
you see what's said about our bill&mdash;eh? The sooner
it's made out the better, I should say&mdash;and&mdash;ahem!
hem!&mdash;while Mr. Aubrey's on the tight rope he won't
think of looking down at the particular items, will he?
I should say, <i>now's</i> our time; and we should strike while
the iron's hot! I've got <i>rather</i> a stiff entry, I can assure
you. I must say Snap's done his duty; and <i>I've</i> not
had my eyes shut&mdash;or my pen idle! You know one
<i>must</i> live in these hard times&mdash;eh?" Here Mr. Quirk
winked very knowingly.</p>

<p>"You must not <i>overdo</i> it, Mr. Quirk&mdash;but all that I
leave, as usual, to your admirable management, as to that
of a first-rate man of business. You know I'm a sad hand
at accounts; but you and Snap are perfect adepts&mdash;in
short, I'm satisfied you'll do all that should be
done."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, trust us!" interrupted Quirk, quickly, with
a significant nod, and fancying himself and Snap already
at work, plundering the poor Aubreys. "And, by the
way, Gammon, there are the mesne profits&mdash;that's a
mighty fine postscript of theirs, isn't it?" and replacing
his spectacles, he read it over aloud. "All my eye, of
course!" he added, as he laid down the letter&mdash;"but I
suppose one must give 'em a little time; it <i>is</i> a little hard
on him just at present; but then, to be sure, that's <i>his</i>
look-out&mdash;not ours, or Titmouse's!&mdash;Off-hand, I should
say we ought to be content with&mdash;say&mdash;twenty thousand
down, and the rest within two years, so as to give him
time to look about him a little"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That will be quite an after consideration," said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Gammon, who, for the last few minutes, had appeared
lost in thought.</p>

<p>"Egad&mdash;an <i>after</i> consideration? Hang me if I think
so, Gammon! There's a certain <i>bond</i>&mdash;eh? don't you
recollect"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I assure you, Mr. Quirk, that my eye is fixed quite
as steadily and anxiously on that point as yours," said
Gammon, gravely.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;thank you, Gammon!" replied Quirk,
with the air of a man suddenly relieved from apprehension&mdash;"it
couldn't possibly be in better hands. Lud&mdash;to
go wrong <i>there</i>! It would send me to my grave at a
hand gallop&mdash;it would, so help me Heaven, Gammon!&mdash;Titmouse&mdash;by
the way&mdash;is a queer hand to deal with&mdash;isn't
he? Wasn't he strange and bumptious the other
day? Egad, it made me quake! Need we tell him, just
yet," he dropped his voice, "of the letter we've got?
Couldn't we safely say only that they have sent us
word that we shall have Yatton by the 17th of next
month?"</p>

<p>"Very great caution is necessary, Mr. Quirk, just
now"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You <i>don't</i> think the young scamp's going to turn
round on us, and snap his fingers in our face, eh?" inquired
Mr. Quirk, apprehensively, violently twirling about
his watch-key.</p>

<p>"If you leave him implicitly to me, you shall get all
you want," replied Gammon, very gravely, and very pointedly.
Quirk's color changed a little, as he felt the keen
gray eye of Gammon fixed upon him, and he involuntarily
shrank under it.</p>

<p>"You'll excuse me, Gammon," at length said he, with
rather a disturbed air; "but there's no fathoming you,
when you get into one of your mysterious humors; and
you always look so particularly strange whenever we get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
on this subject! What can you know that I don't&mdash;or
<i>ought</i> not to know?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing, I assure you," replied Gammon,
with a gay smile.</p>

<p>"Well, I should have <i>thought</i> not. But, coming back
to the main point, if one could but <i>touch</i> some part of that
same ten thousand pounds, I <i>should</i> be a happy man!&mdash;Consider
Gammon, what a draught there has been on my
purse for this last sixteen months! Ecod!&mdash;the sleepless
nights it has cost me!"</p>

<p>"Well, can you doubt being soon richly repaid, my
dear sir? Only don't be too hasty."</p>

<p>"I take it, Gammon, we've a lien on the rents now
in the banker's hands, and to become due next quarter-day,
and on the first instalment of the mesne profits,
both for our bill of costs, and in respect of that same
bond?"</p>

<p>"Mesne profits, Mr. Quirk?" echoed Gammon, rather
quickly; "you seem to take it for granted that they are all
ready to be paid over! Even supposing Titmouse not to
grow restive, do you suppose it probable that Mr. Aubrey,
after so vast and sudden a sacrifice, can have more than
a very few thousands&mdash;probably hundreds&mdash;to keep him
and his family from immediate want, since we have reason
to believe he has got no other resources than Yatton?"</p>

<p>"Not got 'em&mdash;not got 'em? D&mdash;n him! then he
must look sharp and <i>get</i> 'em, that's all! You know we
can't be trifled with; we must look after the interests of&mdash;Titmouse.
And what's he to start with, if there's no
mesne profits forthcoming? But, hang it! they must;
I should say a gentle pressure, by-and-by, as soon as Aubrey's
fairly got out of Yatton, must produce money, or
<i>security</i>&mdash;he must know quantities of people of rank and
substance that would rush forward, if they once heard
him squeal"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, you're for putting the thumbscrews on at once&mdash;eh?"
inquired Gammon, with subdued energy, and a
very strange sort of smile.</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;capital&mdash;that's <i>just</i> what I meant!"&mdash;quoth
Quirk.</p>

<p>"Eugh! you heartless old reprobate!" thought Gammon,
nearly on the point of expressing as much; but his
momentary excitement passed off unobserved by Mr.
Quirk. "And, I must say, I agree with you," added
Gammon, calmly, "we ought in justice to see you first
reimbursed your very heavy outlays, Mr. Quirk."</p>

<p>"Well, that's honorable, Gammon.&mdash;Oh, Gammon,
how I <i>wish</i> you would let me make a friend of you!"
suddenly added Mr. Quirk, eying wistfully his surprised
companion.</p>

<p>"If you have one sincere, disinterested friend in the
world, Mr. Quirk, I am he," said Mr. Gammon, throwing
great warmth into his manner, perceiving that Mr. Quirk
was laboring with some communication of which he wished
to deliver himself.</p>

<p>"Gammon, Gammon! how I <i>wish</i> I could think so!"
replied Quirk, looking earnestly, yet half distrustingly, at
Gammon, and fumbling about his hands in his pockets.
The mild and friendly expression of Gammon's countenance,
however, invited communicativeness; and after
softly opening and shutting the two doors, to ascertain
that no one was trying to overhear what might be passing,
he returned to his chair, which he drew closer to
Gammon, who noticed this air of preparation with not a
little curiosity.</p>

<p>"I may be wrong, Gammon," commenced Mr. Quirk, in
a low tone; "but I do believe you've always felt a kind
of personal friendship towards me; and there ought to be
no secrets among friends. <i>Friends</i>, indeed? Perhaps it's
premature to mention so small a matter; but at a certain
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
silversmith's, not a thousand miles from the Strand,
there's at this moment in hand, as a present from me to
you"&mdash;(Oh dear, dear! Mr. Quirk! what a shocking untruth!
and at your advanced period of life, too!)&mdash;"as
elegant a gold snuff-box as can be made, with a small inscription
on the lid. I hope you won't value it the less
for its being the gift of old Caleb Quirk"&mdash;&mdash;he paused
and looked earnestly at Mr. Gammon.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Quirk, you have taken me," said his
bland partner, apparently with great emotion, "quite by
surprise. Value it? I will preserve it to the latest moment
of my life, as a memorial of one whom the more I
know of, the more I respect and admire!"</p>

<p>"You, Gammon, are in your prime&mdash;scarce even that&mdash;but
I am growing old"&mdash;&mdash;tears appeared to glisten
in the old gentleman's eyes; Gammon, looking much
moved, shook him cordially by the hand in silence, wondering
what upon earth was coming next. "Yes;&mdash;old
Caleb Quirk's day is drawing to a close&mdash;I feel it, Gammon,
I feel it! But I shall leave behind me&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;child&mdash;an
only daughter, Gammon;" that gentleman
gazed at the speaker with an expression of respectful sympathy;&mdash;"Dora:
I don't think you can have known Dora
so long, Gammon, without feeling a <i>leetle</i> interest in her!"
Here Gammon's color mounted rapidly; and he looked
with feelings of a novel description at his senior partner.
Could it be possible that old Quirk wished to bring about
a match between his daughter and Mr. Gammon? That
gentleman's thoughts were for a moment confused. All
he could do was to bow with an earnest&mdash;an anxious&mdash;a
deprecating air; and Mr. Quirk, rather hastily, proceeded,&mdash;"and
when I assure you, Gammon, that it is in
your power to make an old friend and his only daughter
happy and proud,"&mdash;Gammon began to draw his breath
hurriedly, and to look more and more apprehensively at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
his senior partner,&mdash;"in short, my dear friend Gammon,
let me out with it at once&mdash;my daughter's over head
and ears in love with Titmouse! She is, so help me
Heaven!"</p>

<p>["Whew!" thought Gammon, suddenly and infinitely
relieved.]</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear sir, is that all?" he exclaimed, and shook
Mr. Quirk cordially by the hand,&mdash;"at length you have
made a friend of me indeed! But, to tell you the truth,
I have long suspected as much; I have indeed!"</p>

<p>"Have you really? Hang me if anything can escape
your lynx's eyes!&mdash;Well! there <i>is</i> no accounting for
tastes, is there?&mdash;especially among the women? Poor
Dora's quite lost her heart&mdash;quite&mdash;she has&mdash;so help
me Heaven!" continued Mr. Quirk, energetically.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear sir, and why this <i>surprise</i>?" inquired
Gammon, earnestly. "I consider Titmouse to be a very
handsome young fellow; and that he is already rapidly
acquiring very gentlemanly manners; and as to his <i>fortune</i>&mdash;really&mdash;when
one thinks of the thing&mdash;it would
be most desirable to bring it about! Indeed, the sooner
his heart's fixed, and his word's pledged, the better&mdash;for
you must of course be aware that there will be many
schemers on the look-out to entrap his frank and inexperienced
nature&mdash;look, for instance, at Tag-rag."</p>

<p>"Eugh!" exclaimed Mr. Quirk, with a sudden motion
of sickening disgust&mdash;"the old beast! I smoked him
long ago! Now, <i>that</i> I call villany, Gammon; infernal
villany! Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed, Mr. Quirk, I do; I quite agree with
you! Upon my honor, I think it is a part of even <i>my</i>
duty towards our confiding and inexperienced client,
if possible, to protect him against such infamous
designs."</p>

<p>"Right&mdash;right, Gammon; by Jove, you're quite right&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<i>quite</i> agree with you!" replied Quirk, earnestly, not
observing the lambent smile upon the features of his calm,
crafty, and sarcastic companion.</p>

<p>"You see, however," said Gammon, "we've a very delicate
and difficult game to play with old Tag-rag. He's
certainly a toad, ugly and venomous&mdash;but then he's got
a jewel in his head&mdash;he's got money, you know, and, to
serve <i>our</i> purposes, we must really give him some hopes
about his daughter and Titmouse."</p>

<p>"Faugh! eugh! feugh! Nasty wretch! a little trollop!
It makes one sick to hear of her! And, by the way, now
we're on that subject, Gammon, what do we want of this
wretch Tag-rag, now that Titmouse has actually got the
property?"</p>

<p>"Want of him? Money&mdash;security, my dear sir!&mdash;money!"</p>

<p>"But, curse me! (excuse me, Gammon,) why go to
Tag-rag? <i>That's</i> what I can't understand! Surely any
one will advance almost any amount of money to Titmouse,
with such security as he can now give!"</p>

<p>"Very possibly&mdash;probably"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Possibly? Why, I myself don't mind advancing him
five thousand&mdash;nay, ten thousand pounds&mdash;when we've
once got hold of the title-deeds."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," interrupted Gammon, calmly, but with
a very serious air, and a slight change of color which did
not happen to attract the notice of his eager companion,
"there are reasons why I should dissuade you from doing
so; upon my word there are; farther than that I do not
think it necessary to go; but I have gone far enough, I
know well, to do you a real service."</p>

<p>Mr. Quirk listened to all this with an air of the utmost
amazement&mdash;even open-mouthed amazement. "What
reason, Gammon, <i>can</i> there be against my advancing
money on a security worth at least twenty times the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
sum borrowed?" he inquired with visible distrust of his
companion.</p>

<p>"I can but assure you, that were I called upon to say
whether I would advance a serious sum of money to Titmouse
on the security of the Yatton estates, I should at
all events require a most substantial <i>collateral</i> security."</p>

<p>"Mystery again!" exclaimed Mr. Quirk, a sigh of vexation
escaping him. "You'll excuse me, Gammon, but
you'd puzzle an angel, to say nothing of the devil! May
I presume for one moment, so far on our personal and
professional relationship, as to ask what the reason is on
which your advice rests?"</p>

<p>"Mere caution&mdash;excessive caution&mdash;anxiety to place
you out of the way of all risk. Surely, is your borrower
so soon to be pronounced firm in the saddle?"</p>

<p>"If you know anything, Gammon, that I don't, it's your
bounden duty to communicate it! <i>Look at our articles!</i>"</p>

<p>"It is; <i>but do I</i> know anything! Prove that, Mr.
Quirk, and you need trouble yourself no more!&mdash;but, in
the mean while, (without saying how much I feel hurt at
your evident distrust,) I have but a word or two further
to add on this point."</p>

<p>When Mr. Gammon chose, he could assume an expression
of feature, a tone of voice, and a manner which
indicated to the person he was addressing, that he was
announcing a matured opinion, an inflexible determination&mdash;and
this, moreover, in the calmest, quietest way
imaginable. Thus it was that he now said to Mr. Quirk,
"My opinion is, that you should get <i>some third party</i> or
parties to advance any required sum, and prevail upon
Tag-rag to join in a collateral security, without&mdash;if possible&mdash;making
him aware of the extent of liability he is
incurring. By exciting him with the ridiculous notion of
an attachment between his daughter and Titmouse, he may
be induced to give his signature, as to some complimentary
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
matter of form only&mdash;Now, that's my opinion, Mr.
Quirk; not lightly or hastily formed; and it rests upon
a deep feeling of personal regard towards you, and also
our common interests."</p>

<p>Mr. Quirk had listened to this communication in perturbed
silence, eying the speaker with a ludicrous expression
of mingled chagrin, apprehension, and bewilderment.
"Gammon," at length said he, affecting a smile, "do you
remember, when you, and I, and Dora, went to the play
to see some German thing or other&mdash;Foss was the name,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Faust&mdash;Faust," interrupted Gammon, curiously.</p>

<p>"Well; and now, what was the name of that fellow
that was always&mdash;Meph&mdash;Meph&mdash;what was it?"</p>

<p>"Mephistopheles," replied Gammon, unable to repress
a smile.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;yes! so it was. That's all; I only wanted to
think of the name&mdash;I'd forgotten it. I beg your pardon,
Gammon."</p>

<p>This was poor Mr. Quirk's way of being very sarcastic
with his friend. He thought that he had now cut him to
the very quick.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for what's passed between us to-day,
Gammon, I should almost begin to think that you
were not sincere in your friendship"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did I ever deceive you? Did I ever attempt to overreach
you in anything, Mr. Quirk?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;," replied Mr. Quirk&mdash;but not in the
readiest manner, or most confident tone in the world,&mdash;"I
certainly can't say I ever found you out&mdash;but I'll
tell you what, we each keep a precious sharp look-out
after each other, too&mdash;don't we?" he inquired with a
faint smile, which seemed for a moment reflected upon
the face of Gammon.</p>

<p>"How long," said the latter, "I am to be the subject
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of such unkind suspicions, I do not know; but your
nature is suspicious; and as every one has his fault, that
is the alloy in the otherwise pure gold of your manly,
generous, and straightforward character. Time may show
how you have wronged me. My anxious wish is, Mr.
Quirk, to witness your daughter occupying a position in
which we may all be proud to see her." Here a smile
shot across Quirk's anxious countenance, like evening sunshine
on troubled waters.</p>

<p>"I do really believe, Gammon," said he, eagerly, "that
Dora's just the kind of girl to suit Titmouse"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"So indeed, my dear sir, do I. There's a mingled
softness and spirit in Miss Quirk"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"She's a good girl, a good girl, Gammon! I hope he'll
use her well if he gets her." His voice trembled. "She's
got very much attached to him! Gad, she's quite altered
lately; and my sister tells me that she's always playing
dismal music when he's not there. But we can talk over
these matters at another time. Gad, Gammon, you can't
think how it's relieved me, to open my mind to you
on this matter! We quite understand each other <i>now</i>,
Gammon&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Quite," replied Gammon, pointedly; and Mr. Quirk
having quitted the room, the former prepared to answer
Messrs. Runnington's letter. But first he leaned back,
and reflected on several points of their late conversation.
Of course, he had resolved that Miss Quirk should never
become Mrs. Titmouse! And what struck him as not a
little singular was this; viz. that Mr. Quirk should have
made no observation on the circumstance that Gammon
allowed him to risk his daughter, and her all, upon
chances which he pronounced too frail to warrant advancing
a thousand or two of money! Yet so it was.</p>

<p>This was the answer he presently wrote to the letter of
Messrs. Runnington:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div align="right"> "<i>Saffron Hill, 26th April 18&mdash;.</i> </div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:</p>

<div align="center"> "<i>Doe</i> d. <i>Titmouse</i> v. <i>Jolter</i>. </div>
<br />

<p>"We are favored with your letter of this day's date; and beg
to assure you how very highly we appreciate the prompt and
honorable course which has been taken by your client, under
circumstances calculated to excite the greatest possible commiseration.
Every expression of respectful sympathy, on our parts,
and on that of our client, Mr. Titmouse, which you may think
fit to convey to your distinguished client, is his.</p>

<p>"We shall be prepared to receive possession of the Yatton
estates on the day you mention&mdash;namely, the 17th May next,
on behalf of our client, Mr. Titmouse; on whose behalf, also,
we beg to thank you for your communication concerning the
last quarter's rents.</p>

<p>"With reference to the question of the mesne profits, we
cannot doubt that your client will promptly pursue the same
line of honorable conduct which he has hitherto adopted; and
sincerely trust that a good understanding in this matter will
speedily exist between our respective clients.</p>

<p>"As you have intimated a wish upon the subject, we beg to
inform you that we have given instructions for making out and
delivering our bill herein.</p>

<div align="center"> "We are, Gentlemen, </div>
<div align="right"> "Your obedient humble servants, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div align="right"> "<span class="smcap">Quirk, Gammon, &amp; Snap.</span> </div>

<div align="left"> "<span class="smcap">Messrs. Runnington &amp; Co.</span>" </div>
</blockquote>

<p>Having finished writing the above letter, Gammon sat
back in his chair, with folded arms, and entered upon a
long train of thought&mdash;revolving many matters which
were worthy of the profound consideration they then
received.</p>

<p>When Gammon and Titmouse returned to town from
York, they were fortunate in having the inside of the
coach to themselves for nearly the whole of the way&mdash;an
opportunity which Gammon improved to the utmost, by
deepening the impression he had already made in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
mind of Titmouse, of the truth of one great fact&mdash;namely,
that he and his fortunes would quickly part company, if
Gammon should at any time so will&mdash;which never would,
however, come to pass, as long as Titmouse recognized and
deferred to the authority of Gammon in all things. In
vain did Titmouse inquire how this could be. Gammon
was impenetrable, mysterious, authoritative; and at length
enjoined Titmouse to absolute secrecy concerning the existence
of the fact in question, on pain of the infliction
of those consequences to which I have already alluded.
Gammon assured him that there were many plans and
plots hatching against him (Titmouse;) but that it was
in his (Gammon's) power to protect him from them all.
Gammon particularly enjoined him, moreover, to consult
the feelings, and attend to the suggestions of Mr. Quirk,
wherever Mr. Gammon did not intimate to the contrary;
and wound up all by telling him, that as he, Gammon,
was the only person on earth&mdash;and this he really believed
to be the case, as the reader may hereafter see&mdash;who
knew the exact position of Titmouse, so he had devoted
himself for his life to the advancing and securing
the interests of that fortunate gentleman.</p>

<p>For about a fortnight after their return, Titmouse, at
Gammon's instance, continued at his former lodgings;
but at length complained so earnestly of their dismal
quietude, and of their being out of the way of "<i>life</i>,"
that Gammon yielded to his wishes, and, together with
Mr. Quirk, consented to his removing to a central spot&mdash;in
fact, to the <span class="smcap">Cabbage-stalk Hotel</span>, Covent Garden&mdash;a
queer enough name, to be sure; but it was the family
name of a great wholesale green-grocer, who owned most
of the property thereabouts. It was not without considerable
uneasiness and anxiety that Messrs. Quirk and
Snap beheld this change of residence, apprehensive that
it might have the effect of estranging Titmouse from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
them; but since Gammon assented to it, they had nothing
for it but to acquiesce, considering Titmouse's proximity
to his splendid independence. They resolved, however,
as far as in each of them lay, not to let themselves be
forgotten by Titmouse. Pending the rule for the new
trial, Mr. Quirk had been so confident concerning the
issue, that he greatly increased the allowance of Titmouse;
to an extent, indeed, which admitted of his entering
into almost all the gayeties that his as yet scarce
initiated heart could desire. In the first place, he constantly
added to his wardrobe. Then he took lessons,
every other day, in "the noble art of self-defence;" which
gave him an opportunity of forming, with great ease, at
once an extensive and brilliant circle of acquaintance.
Fencing-rooms, wrestling-rooms, shooting-galleries, places
for pigeon-shooting, cock-fighting, dog-fighting, and billiard-rooms;
the water, and boat-racing&mdash;these were the dazzling
scenes which occupied the chief portion of each day.
Then, in the evenings, there were theatres, great and
small, the various taverns, and other places of nocturnal
resort, which are the secret pride and glory of the metropolis.
In addition to this, at an advanced period of
the night, or rather very early hour in the morning, he
sedulously strove to perfect himself in those higher arts
and accomplishments, formerly excelled in by one or two
of the more eminent of the youthful aristocracy, viz. breaking
windows, pulling bells, wrenching off knockers,<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> extinguishing
lamps, tripping up old women, watchmen, and
children, and spoiling their clothes;&mdash;ah, how often in
his humbler days, had his heart panted in noble rivalry
of such feats as these, and emulation of the notoriety
which they earned for the glittering miscreants excelling
in them! Ah, Titmouse, Titmouse! Now is your time!
<i>Macte novâ virtute, puer!</i></p>

<p>That he could long frequent such scenes as these without
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
forming an extensive and varied acquaintance, would
be a very unlikely thing to suppose; and there was one
who would fain have joined him in his new adventures&mdash;one
who, as I have already intimated, had initiated him
into the scenes with which he was now becoming so familiar;
I mean Snap, who had been at once his</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Guide, philosopher, and friend;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but who now had fewer and fewer opportunities of associating
with him, inasmuch as his (Snap's) nose was continually
"kept at the grindstone" in Saffron Hill, to
compensate for the lack of attention to the business of
the office of his senior partners, owing to their incessant
occupation with the affairs of Titmouse. Still, however,
he now and then contrived to remind Titmouse of his
(Snap's) existence, by sending him intimations of interesting
trials at the Old Bailey and elsewhere, and securing
him a good seat to view both the criminal and the
spectators&mdash;often persons of the greatest rank, fashion,
and beauty; for so it happened that, in this country, the
more hideous the crime, the more intense the curiosity of
the upper classes of both sexes to witness the miscreant
perpetrator; the more disgusting the details, the greater
the avidity with which they are listened to by the distinguished
auditors;&mdash;the reason being plain, that, as they
have exhausted the pleasures and excitements afforded by
their own sphere of action and enjoyment, their palled and
sated appetites require novel and more powerful stimulants.
Hence, at length, we see "fashionables" peopling
even the condemned cell&mdash;rushing, in excited groups,
after the shuddering malefactor, staggering, half palsied,
and with horror-laden eye, on his way to the gallows!
As soon as old Quirk had obtained an inkling of Titmouse's
taste in these matters, he afforded him many
opportunities of gratifying it. Once or twice the old gentleman
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
succeeded in obtaining for him, even the gratification
of shaking the cold and pinioned hands of wretches
within a few minutes' time of their being led out for
execution!</p>

<p>This is a brief and general account of the way in which
Titmouse passed his time, and laid the groundwork of
that solid, extensive, and practical acquaintance with men
and things, which was requisite to enable him to occupy
with dignity and advantage the splendid station to which
he was on the point of being elevated.</p>

<p>But let us not lose sight of our early and interesting
friends, the Tag-rags&mdash;a thing which both Quirk and
Gammon resolved should not happen to Titmouse: for,
on the very first Sunday after his arrival in town from
York, a handsome glass-coach might have been seen,
about two o'clock in the afternoon, drawing up opposite
to the gates of Satin Lodge; from which said coach, the
door having been opened, presently descended Messrs.
Quirk, Gammon, and Titmouse. Now, the Tag-rags always
dined at about two o'clock on Sundays; and, on the
present occasion, Mr., Mrs., and Miss Tag-rag, together
with a pretty constant visitor, the Reverend Dismal Horror,
were sitting at their dinner-table discussing as savory
a leg of roast pork, with apple-sauce, as could at once
have tempted and satisfied the most fastidious and the
most indiscriminating appetite.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma!" exclaimed Miss Tag-rag, faintly, changing
color, as she caught sight, through the blinds, of the approaching
visitors&mdash;"if there isn't Mr. Titmouse!" and
almost dropping on the table her plate, in which, with an
air of tender gallantry, pious Mr. Horror was in the act
of depositing some greens, she flew out of the room, darted
up-stairs, and in a trice was standing, with beating heart,
before her glass, hastily twirling her ringlets round her
trembling fingers, and making one or two slight alterations
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in her dress. Her papa and mamma started up at
the same moment, hastily wiping their mouths on the
corners of the table-cloth; and, after a hurried apology
to their reverend and astounded guest, whom they begged
"to go on eating till they came back"&mdash;they bounced into
the little drawing-room, in just time enough to appear (as
they thought) to have been seated there for some time; but
they were both rather red in the face, and flustered in their
manner. Yet, how abortive was their attempt to disguise
the truly disgraceful fact of their having been at dinner
when their distinguished visitors arrived! For, firstly,
the house was redolent of the odors of roast pork, sage and
onion stuffing, and greens; secondly, the red-faced servant
girl was peering round the corner of the kitchen stairs,
as if watching an opportunity to whip off a small dinner
tray that stood between the dining-room and drawing-room;
and thirdly, the visitors caught a glimpse of the
countenance of the reverend young guest, who was holding
open the dining-room door just wide enough to enable
him to see who passed on to the drawing-room; for, in
truth, the name which had escaped from the lips of Miss
Tag-rag, was one which always excited unpleasant feelings
in the breast of her spiritual-minded friend.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. and Mrs. Tag-rag! 'Pon my soul&mdash;glad to
see you&mdash;and&mdash;hope you're all well?" commenced
Titmouse, with an air of easy confidence and grace. Mr.
Gammon calmly introduced himself and Mr. Quirk.</p>

<p>"We were just going to sit down to&mdash;<i>lunch</i>," said Mr.
Tag-rag, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"You won't take a little, will you, gentlemen?" inquired
Mrs. Tag-rag, faintly; and both the worthy couple
felt infinite relief on being assured that the great people
"had already lunched." Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Tag-rag
could take their eyes off Mr. Titmouse, whose easy nonchalance
convinced them that he must have been keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the society of lords. He was just inquiring&mdash;as he ran
his hand through his hair, and gently smacked his slight
ebony cane against his leg&mdash;after Miss Tag-rag, when,
pale and agitated, and holding in her hand a pocket-handkerchief,
which she had first suffused with musk and
bergamot, designed to overcome so much of the vulgar
odor of dinner as might be lingering about <i>her</i>&mdash;that
interesting young lady entered. Titmouse rose and received
her in a familiar, forward manner; she turning
white and red by turns. She looked such a shrivelled
little ugly formal creature, that Titmouse conceived quite
a hatred of her, through recollecting that he had once
thought such an inferior piece of goods superfine! Old
Quirk and Tag-rag, every now and then, cast distrustful
glances at each other; but Gammon kept all in a calm
flow of small talk, which at length restored those whom
they had come to see, to something like self-possession.
As for Mr. Quirk, the more he looked at Miss Tag-rag,
the more pride and satisfaction he felt in reflecting upon
the unfavorable contrast she must present, in Titmouse's
eyes, to Miss Quirk. After a little further conversation,
principally concerning the brilliant success of Titmouse,
Mr. Quirk came to the business of the day, and invited
Mr., Mrs., and Miss Tag-rag to dinner at Alibi House, on
the ensuing Sunday, at six o'clock&mdash;apologizing for the
absence of Miss Quirk, on the score of indisposition&mdash;she
being at the time in the highest possible state of health.
Mrs. Tag-rag was on the point of saying something deprecatory
of their dining out on Sunday, as contrary to
their rule; but a sudden recollection of the earthly interests
she might peril by so doing, aided by a fearfully significant
glance from Mr. Tag-rag, restrained her. The
invitation was, therefore, accepted in a very obsequious
manner; and soon afterwards their great visitors took
their departure, leaving Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Tag-rag
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
in a state of very great excitement. Goodness! could
there be a doubt that there must be some very potent
attraction at Satin Lodge to bring thither Titmouse, after
all that had occurred? And where could reside the point
of that attraction, but in Miss Tag-rag?</p>

<p>As soon as their visitors' glass-coach had driven off&mdash;its
inmates laughing heartily at the people they had just
quitted&mdash;Mr., Mrs., and Miss Tag-rag returned to the
dining-table, like suddenly disturbed fowl returning to
their roost, when the disturbance has ceased. Profuse
were their apologies to Mr. Horror; not aware, however,
that he had improved the opportunity afforded by their
absence, to recruit his exhausted energies with a couple
of glasses of port wine from a decanter which stood on
the sideboard&mdash;a circumstance which he did not deem
important enough to mention. Vehemently suspecting
as he did, what was the state of things with reference to
Mr. Titmouse and Miss Tag-rag, it was somewhat of a
trial of temper to the exemplary young pastor&mdash;and calculated
to interfere grievously with the preparation for
his evening duties&mdash;to have to listen, for the remainder
of the afternoon, to the praises of Titmouse, and speculations
concerning the immensity of his fortune&mdash;matters,
indeed, (in his pious estimation,) <i>of the earth</i>, <i>earthy</i>. In
vain did the worthy minister strive, every now and then,
to divert the current of conversation into a more profitable
channel&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> towards himself; all he said was evidently
lost upon her for whose ear it was intended. She was in
a revery, and often sighed. The principal figures before
her mind's eye were&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tittlebat Titmouse, Esquire</span>, and
<span class="smcap">the Rev. Dismal Horror</span>. The latter was about twenty-six,
(he had been "called to the work of the ministry" in
his sixteenth year;) short in stature; his face slightly
pitted with small-pox; his forehead narrow; his eyes
cold and watery; no eyebrows or whiskers; high cheekbones;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
his short dark hair combed primly forward over
each temple, and twisted into a sort of topknot in front;
he wore no shirt-collar, but had a white neck-handkerchief
tied very formally, and was dressed in an ill-made
suit of black. He spoke in a drawling, canting tone; and
his countenance was overspread with a demure expression
of&mdash;<small>CUNNING</small>, <i>trying to look religious</i>. Then he was
always talking about himself, and his chapel, and the
devil, and the bottomless pit, and the number of souls
which he had saved, and the number of those whom he
knew were damned, and many more who certainly would be
damned; and other cheerful and interesting matters of
that sort, intrusted&mdash;it would seem&mdash;to his confidential
keeping. All this might be very well in its way, began
to think Miss Tag-rag&mdash;but it was possible to choke a
dog with pudding. Poor girl, can you wonder at her
dwelling fondly upon the image of Titmouse? So splendidly
dressed, so handsome, such a fashionable air, and
with&mdash;ten thousand a-year! When she put all these
things together, it almost looked like a dream; such
good fortune could never be in store for a poor simple
girl like herself. Yet there was such a thing as&mdash;love at
first sight! After tea they all walked down to Mr. Horror's
meeting-house. It was very crowded; and it was
remarked that the eloquent young preacher had never
delivered a more impassioned sermon from that pulpit:
it was sublime. Oh, how bitterly he denounced "worldly-mindedness!"
What a vivid picture he drew of the
flourishing green bay-tree of the wicked, suddenly blasted
in the moment of its pride and strength; while the righteous
should shine like stars in the firmament forever and
ever! Who cannot see here shadowed out the characters
of Titmouse and of Horror respectively?&mdash;who hesitate
between the two? And when at length, the sermon over,
he sat down in his pulpit, (the congregation also sitting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and singing, which had a somewhat queer effect,) and drew
gracefully across his damp forehead his white pocket-handkerchief,
which had been given him by Miss Tag-rag;
and looked with an air of most interesting languor
and exhaustion towards Mr. Tag-rag's pew, where sat
that young lamb of his flock&mdash;Miss Tag-rag&mdash;her father
the wealthiest man in the congregation, and she his only
child&mdash;he felt a most lively and tender interest in her
welfare&mdash;her spiritual welfare, and resolved to call the
next morning; entertaining an humble hope of finding
that his zealous labors had not been in vain, that he had
not missed the mark at which he had been secretly aiming!
Was one fruit of the pious pastor's exertions the
benignant temper which Tag-rag, to the amazement of
his shopmen, evinced the next morning, for at least an
hour? Would that the like good effects had been visible
in Mrs. and Miss Tag-rag; but&mdash;alas that I should have
to record it!&mdash;it was so far otherwise, that they laid
aside some fancy-fair work on which Mr. Horror had set
them&mdash;for the whole week, devoting it, instead, to the
preparation of those dresses with which they purposed
the profanation of the ensuing Sunday.</p>

<p>That day at length arrived, and precisely at six o'clock
a genteel fly deposited the visitants from Satin Lodge at
the splendid entrance to Alibi House. There was the
big footman&mdash;shoulder-knot, red breeches, and all. Tag-rag
felt a <i>little</i> nervous. Before they had entered the
gates, the fond proud parents had kissed their trembling
daughter, and entreated her "to keep her spirits up!"
The exhortation was needful; for when she saw the sort
of style that awaited them, she became not a little agitated.
When she entered the hall&mdash;ah! on a chair lay
a glossy new hat, and a delicate ebony walking-stick; so he
had come&mdash;was then up-stairs!&mdash;Miss Tag-rag trembled
in every limb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know, my dear," whispered Mrs. Tag-rag to
her husband, with a subdued sigh, as they followed the
splendid footman up-stairs,&mdash;"it may be all uncommon
grand; but somehow I'm afraid we're doing wrong&mdash;it's
the Lord's Day&mdash;see if any good comes of it."</p>

<p>"Tut&mdash;hold your tongue! Let's have no nonsense,"
sternly whispered Mr. Tag-rag to his submissive wife.</p>

<p>"Your name, sir?" quoth the footman, in a sort of
gentlemanly way.</p>

<p>"Mr., Mrs., and Miss Tag-rag," replied Mr. Tag-rag,
after clearing his throat; and so they were announced,
Miss Quirk coming forward to receive the ladies with the
most charming affability. There stood Titmouse, in an
easy attitude, with his hands stuck into his coat-pockets,
and resting on his hips, in a very delicate and elegant
fashion. How completely he seemed at his ease!</p>

<p>"Oh Lord!" thought the almost trembling Tag-rag,
"that's the young fellow I used to go on so to!"</p>

<p>In due time dinner was announced; and who can describe
the rapture that thrilled through the bosoms of the
three Tag-rags, when Mr. Quirk requested Mr. Titmouse
to take down&mdash;Miss Tag-rag!! Her father took down
Mrs. Alias; Mr. Quirk, Mrs. Tag-rag; and Gammon, Miss
Quirk. She really might have been proud of her partner.
Gammon was about thirty-six years old; above the
average height; with a very easy, calm, gentlemanly appearance
and address, and an intellectual and even handsome
countenance; though it occasionally exhibited, to a
keen observer, a sinister expression. He wore a blue coat,
a plain white waistcoat, (not disfigured by any glistening
fiddle-faddle of pins, chains, or quizzing-glasses,) black trousers,
and plain black silk stockings. There was at once an
appearance of neatness and carelessness; and there was
such a ready smile&mdash;such a bland ease and self-possession
about him&mdash;as communicated itself to those whom
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
he addressed. I hardly know, Mr. Gammon, why I have
thus noticed so particularly your outward appearance.
It certainly, on the occasion I am describing, struck me
much; but there are such things as <i>whited walls</i> and
<i>painted sepulchres</i>!</p>

<p>Dinner went off very pleasantly, the wines soon communicating
a little confidence to the flustered guests.
Mrs. Tag-rag had drunk so much champagne&mdash;an unusual
beverage for her&mdash;that almost as soon as she had
returned to the drawing-room, she sat down on the sofa
and fell asleep, leaving the two young ladies to amuse each
other as best they might; for Mrs. Alias was very deaf,
and moreover very stiff and distant, and sat looking at them
in silence. To return to the dining-room for a moment.
'T was quite delightful to see the sort of friendship that
seemed to grow up between Quirk and Tag-rag, as their
heads got filled with wine; at the same time each of them
half unconsciously drawing closer and closer to Titmouse,
who sat between them&mdash;volubility itself. They soon
dropped all disguise&mdash;each plainly under the impression
that the other could not, or did not, observe him; and at
length, impelled by their overmastering motives, they became
so barefaced in their sycophancy&mdash;evidently forgetting
that Gammon was present&mdash;that he could several
times, with only the utmost difficulty, refrain from bursting
into laughter at the earnest devotion with which these
two worshippers of the little golden calf strove to attract
the attention of their divinity, and recommend themselves
to its favor.</p>

<p>At length the four gentlemen repaired to the drawing-room,
whence issued the sounds of music; and on entering,
they beheld the two lovely performers seated at the
piano, engaged upon a duet. The plump flaxen-haired
Miss Quirk, in her flowing white muslin dress, her thick
gold chain and massive bracelets, formed rather a strong
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
contrast to her sallow skinny little companion, in a span-new
slate-colored silk dress, with staring scarlet sash; her
long corkscrew ringlets glistening in bear's grease; and
as for their performance, Miss Quirk played boldly and
well through her part, a smile of contempt now and then
beaming over her countenance at the ridiculous incapacity
of her companion. As soon as the gentlemen made their
appearance the ladies ceased, and withdrew from the piano,
Miss Tag-rag, with a sweet air of simplicity and conscious
embarrassment, gliding towards the sofa, where sat her
mamma asleep, but whom she at once awoke. Mr. Quirk
exclaimed, as evidently elevated with wine, he slapped
his daughter on her fat back, "Ah, Dora, my dove!"
while Tag-rag kissed his daughter's cheek, and squeezed
her hand, and then glanced with a proud and delighted
air at Titmouse, who was lolling at full length upon the
other sofa, picking his teeth. While Miss Quirk was making
tea, Gammon gayly conversing with her, and in an
undertone satirizing Miss Tag-rag, the latter young lady
was gazing, with a timid air, at the various elegant nick-nacks
scattered upon the tables and slabs. One of these
consisted of a pretty little box, about a foot square, with
a glass lid, through which she saw the contents; and they
not a little surprised her. They were pieces of cord; and
on looking at one of the sides of the box, she read with a
sudden shudder,&mdash;"<i>With these cords were tied the hands of
Arthur Grizzlegut, executed for high treason, 1st May 18&mdash;.
Presented, as a mark of respect, to Caleb Quirk, Esq., by J&mdash;&mdash;
K&mdash;&mdash;.</i>" Poor Miss Tag-rag recoiled from the box
as if she had seen it filled with writhing adders. She took
an early opportunity, however, of calling her father's attention
to it; and he pronounced it a "most inte<i>rest</i>ing
object," and fetched Mrs. Tag-rag to see it. She agreed,
first, with her daughter; and then with her husband.
Quietly pushing her investigations, Miss Tag-rag by-and-by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
beheld a large and splendidly bound volume&mdash;in fact,
Miss Quirk's album; and, after turning over most of the
leaves, and glancing over the "poetical effusions" and
"prose sentiments" which few fools can abstain from depositing
upon the embossed pages, when solicited by the
lovely proprietresses of such works, behold&mdash;her heart
fluttered&mdash;poor Miss Tag-rag almost dropped the magnificent
volume; for there was the idolized name of Mr.
Titmouse appended to some beautiful poetry&mdash;no doubt
his own handwriting and composition. She read it over
eagerly again and again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tittlebat Titmouse Is My name,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">England Is My Nation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">London Is My Dwelling-Place,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Christ Is My Salvation."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How exquisite&mdash;how touching its simplicity! She looked
anxiously about for writing implements! but not seeing
any, was at length obliged to trust to her memory; on
which, indeed, the remarkable composition was already
inscribed in indelible characters. Miss Quirk, who was
watching her movements, guessed the true cause of her
excitement; and a smile of mingled scorn and pity for
her infatuated delusion shone upon her face; in which,
however, there appeared a little anxiety when she beheld
Titmouse&mdash;(she did not perceive that he did so in consequence
of a motion from Gammon, whose eye governed
his movements as a man's those of his spaniel)&mdash;walk
up to her, and converse with a great appearance of interest.
At length Mr. Tag-rag's "carriage" was announced.
Mr. Quirk gave his arm to Mrs. Tag-rag, and
Mr. Titmouse to the daughter; who endeavored, as she
went down the stairs, to direct melting glances at her
handsome and distinguished companion. They evidently
<i>told</i>, for she could not be mistaken; he certainly once or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
twice squeezed her arm&mdash;and the last fond words he uttered
to her were, "'Pon my soul&mdash;it's early; devilish
sorry your going&mdash;hope you've enjoyed yourself!" As
the Tag-rags drove home, they were all loud in the praises
of those whose splendid hospitality they had been enjoying.
Possessing a daughter, for whom Quirk must naturally
have wished to make so splendid a match as that
with Titmouse&mdash;but who was plainly engaged to Mr.
Gammon&mdash;how kind and disinterested was Mr. Quirk,
in affording every encouragement in his power to the
passion which Titmouse had so manifestly conceived
for Miss Tag-rag! And was there ever so delightful
a person as Gammon? How cordially he had shaken the
hands of each of them at parting! As for Miss Tag-rag,
she felt that if her heart had not been so deeply engaged
to Titmouse, she could have loved Mr. Gammon!</p>

<p>"I hope, Tabby," said Mrs. Tag-rag, with subdued excitement,
as they rattled homeward, "that when you're
Mrs. Titmouse, you'll bring your dear husband to hear
Mr. Horror? You know, we ought to be grateful to the
Lord&mdash;for He has done it!"</p>

<p>"La, ma, how can I tell?" quoth Miss Tag-rag, petulantly.
"I must go where Mr. Titmouse chooses, of
course; and no doubt he'll take sittings in one of the
West End churches; you know, <i>you</i> go where <i>pa</i> goes&mdash;<i>I</i>
go where Titmouse goes! But I <i>will</i> come sometimes,
too&mdash;if it's only to show that I'm not above it, you
know. La, what a stir there will be! The three Miss
Knipps&mdash;I do so hope they'll be there! I'll have your
pew, ma, lined with red velvet; it will look so genteel."</p>

<p>"I'm not quite so sure, Tabby, though," interrupted
her father, with a certain swell of manner, "that we shall,
after a certain event, continue to live in these parts.
There's such a thing as retiring from business, Tabby;
besides, we shall nat'rally wish to be near you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's a <i>love</i> of a man, pa, isn't he?" interrupted Miss
Tag-rag, with irrepressible excitement. Her father folded
her in his arms. They could hardly believe that they
had reached Satin Lodge. That respectable structure,
somehow or other, now looked to the eyes of all of them
shrunk into most contemptible dimensions; and they
quite turned up their noses, involuntarily, on entering
the little passage. What was it to the spacious and
splendid residence which they had quitted? And what,
in all probability, could <i>that</i> be to the mansion&mdash;or any
one, perhaps, of the several mansions&mdash;to which Mr.
Titmouse would be presently entitled, and&mdash;in his right&mdash;some
one else?</p>

<p>Miss Tag-rag said her prayers that evening very briefly&mdash;pausing
for an instant to consider, whether she might
in plain terms pray that she might soon become Mrs. Titmouse;
but the bare thought of such an event so excited
her, that in a sort of confused whirl of delightful feeling,
she suddenly jumped into bed, and slept scarce a wink
all night long. Mr. and Mrs. Tag-rag talked together
very fast for nearly a couple of hours, sleep long fleeing
from the eyes dazzled with so splendid a vision as that
which had floated before them all day. At length Mr.
Tag-rag, getting tired sooner than his wife, became very
sullen, and silent; and on her venturing&mdash;after a few
minutes' pause&mdash;to mention some new idea which had
occurred to her, he told her furiously to "hold her
tongue, and let him go to sleep!"  She obeyed him,
and lay awake till it was broad daylight. About eight
o'clock, Tag-rag, who had overslept himself, rudely roused
her&mdash;imperiously telling her to "go down immediately
and see about breakfast;" then he knocked gently at his
daughter's door; and on her asking who it was, said in
a fond way&mdash;"How are you, Mrs. T.?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>While the brilliant success of Tittlebat Titmouse was
exciting so great a sensation among the inmates of Satin
Lodge and Alibi House, there were also certain quarters
in the upper regions of society, in which it produced
a considerable commotion, and where it was contemplated
with feelings of intense interest; nor without
reason. For indeed to you, reflecting reader, much pondering
men and manners, and observing the influence of
great wealth, especially when suddenly and unexpectedly
acquired, upon all classes of mankind&mdash;it would appear
passing strange that so prodigious an event as that of an
accession to a fortune of ten thousand a-year, and a large
accumulation of money besides, could be looked on with
indifference in those regions where <small>MONEY</small></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Is like the air they breathe&mdash;if they have it not they die;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>in whose absence, all their "honor, love, obedience, troops
of friends," disappear like snow under sunshine; the edifice
of pomp, luxury, and magnificence that "rose like an
exhalation," so disappears&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And, like an insubstantial pageant faded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaves not a rack behind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Take away money</i>, and that which raised its delicate and
pampered possessors above the common condition of mankind&mdash;that
of privation and incessant labor and anxiety&mdash;into
one entirely artificial, engendering totally new
wants and desires, is gone, all gone; and its occupants
suddenly fall, as it were, through a highly rarefied atmosphere,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
breathless and dismayed, into contact with the
chilling exigencies of life, of which till then they had
only heard and read, sometimes with a kind of morbid
sympathy; as we hear and read of a foreign country,
not stirring the while from our snug homes, by whose
comfortable and luxurious firesides we read of the frightful
palsying cold of the polar regions, and for a moment
sigh over and shudder at the condition of their miserable
inhabitants, as vividly pictured to us by adventurous
travellers.</p>

<p>If the reader had reverently cast his eye over the pages
of that glittering centre of aristocratic literature, and inexhaustible
solace against the <i>ennui</i> of a wet day&mdash;I
mean <i>Debrett's Peerage</i>, his attention could not have failed
to be riveted, among a galaxy of brilliant but minor stars,
by the radiance of one transcendent constellation.</p>

<p>Now, as to the above tremendous list of seats and residences,
be it observed that the existence of two of them,
viz. Grosvenor Square and Poppleton Hall, was tolerably
well ascertained by the residence of the august proprietor
of them, and the expenditure therein of his princely revenue
of £5,000 a-year. The existence of the remaining
ones, however, the names of which the diligent chronicler
has preserved with such scrupulous accuracy, had become
somewhat problematical since the era of the civil wars, and
the physical derangement of the surface of the earth in those
parts, which one may conceive to have taken place<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> consequent
upon those events; those imposing feudal residences
having been originally erected in positions so carefully
selected with a view to their security against aggression,
as to have become totally inaccessible&mdash;and indeed unknown,
to the present inglorious and degenerate race, no
longer animated by the spirit of chivalry and adventure.</p>

<p>The reader may by this time have got an intimation
that Tittlebat Titmouse, in a madder freak of Fortune
than any which her incomprehensible Ladyship hath hitherto
exhibited in the pages of this history, is far on his
way towards a dizzy pitch of elevation,&mdash;viz. that he
has now, owing to the verdict of the Yorkshire jury, taken
the place of Mr. Aubrey, and become heir-expectant to
the oldest barony in the kingdom&mdash;between it and him
only one old peer, and his sole child, an unmarried daughter,
intervening. Behold the thing demonstrated to your
very eye, in the Pedigree on the next page, which is only
our former one<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> a little extended.</p>

<p>From this I think it will appear, that on the death of
Augustus, fifth earl and twentieth baron, with no other
issue than Lady Cecilia, the earldom being then extinct,
the barony would descend upon the Lady Cecilia; and
that, in the event of her dying without issue in the lifetime
of her father, Tittlebat Titmouse would, on the earl's
death without other lawful issue, become <span class="smcap">Lord Drelincourt</span>,
twenty-<i>first</i> in the barony! and in the event of
her dying without issue, after her father's death, <span class="smcap">Tittlebat
Titmouse</span> would become the twenty-<i>second</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Drelincourt</span>;
one or other of which two splendid positions,
but for the enterprising agency of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap, would have been occupied by <span class="smcap">Charles
Aubrey, Esq.</span>;&mdash;on considering all which, one cannot
but remember a saying of an ancient poet, who seems to
have kept as keen an eye upon the unaccountable frolics
of the goddess Fortune, as this history shows that I have.
'Tis a passage which any little schoolboy will translate to
his mother or his sisters&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>At the time of which I am writing, the Earl of Dreddlington
was about sixty-seven years old; and he would
have realized the idea of an incarnation of the sublimest
<small>PRIDE</small>. He was of rather a slight make, and, though of
a tolerably advanced age, stood as straight as an arrow.
His hair was glossy, and white as snow: his features were
of an aristocratic cast; their expression was severe and
haughty; and I am compelled to say that there was scarce
a trace of intellect perceptible in them. His manner and
demeanor were cold, imperturbable, inaccessible; wherever
he went&mdash;so to speak&mdash;he radiated cold. Comparative
poverty had embittered his spirit, as his lofty birth and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
ancient descent had generated the pride I have spoken of.
With what calm and supreme self-satisfaction did he look
down upon all lower in the peerage than himself! And
as for a newly-created peer, he looked at such a being
with ineffable disdain. Among his few equals he was
affable enough; and among his inferiors he exhibited an
insupportable appearance of condescension&mdash;one which
excited a wise man's smile of pity and contempt, and a
fool's anger&mdash;both, however, equally nought to the Earl
of Dreddlington!&mdash;If any one could have ventured upon
a <i>post mortem</i> examination of so august a structure as the
earl's carcass, his heart would probably have been found
to be of the size of a pea, and his brain very soft and
flabby; both, however, equal to the small occasions which,
from time to time, called for the exercise of their functions.
The former was occupied almost exclusively by
two feelings&mdash;love of himself and of his daughter, (because
upon her would descend his barony;) the latter
exhibited its powers (supposing the brain to be the seat
of the mind) in mastering the military details requisite
for nominal soldiership; the game of whist; the routine
of petty business in the House of Lords; and the etiquette
of the court. One branch of useful knowledge
by the way he had, however, completely mastered&mdash;that
which is so ably condensed in <i>Debrett</i>; and he became a
sort of oracle in such matters. As for his politics, he professed
Whig principles&mdash;and was, indeed, a bitter though
quiet partisan. In attendance to his senatorial duties,
he practised an exemplary punctuality; was always to be
found in the House at its sitting and rising; and never
once, on any occasion, great or small, voted against his
party. He had never been heard to speak in a full
House; first, because he never could summon nerve
enough for the purpose; secondly, because he never had
anything to say; and lastly, lest he should compromise
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
his dignity, and destroy the <i>prestige</i> of his position, by
not speaking better than any one present. His services
were not, however, entirely overlooked; for, on his party
coming into office for a few weeks, (they knew it could be
for no longer a time,) they made him Lord Steward of the
Household; which was thenceforward an epoch to which
he referred every event of his life, great and small. The
great object of his ambition, ever since he had been of an
age to form large and comprehensive views of action and
conduct, to conceive superior designs, and to achieve distinction
among mankind&mdash;was, to obtain a step in the
peerage; for considering the antiquity of his family, and
his ample, nay, <i>superfluous</i> pecuniary means&mdash;so much
more than adequate to support his present double dignity
of earl and baron&mdash;he thought it but a reasonable
return for his eminent political services, to confer upon
him the honor which he coveted. But his anxiety on
this point had been recently increased a thousand-fold by
one circumstance. A gentleman who held an honorable
and lucrative official situation in the House of Lords, and
who never had treated the Earl of Dreddlington with that
profound obsequiousness which the earl conceived to be
his due&mdash;but, on the contrary, had presumed to consider
himself a man, and an Englishman, equally with
the earl&mdash;had, a short time before, succeeded in establishing
his title to an earldom which had long been
dormant, and was, alas, of creation earlier than that of
Dreddlington. The Earl of Dreddlington took this untoward
circumstance so much to heart, that for some months
afterwards he appeared to be in a decline; always experiencing
a dreadful inward spasm whenever the Earl of
Fitzwalter made his appearance in the House. For this
sad state of things there was plainly but one remedy&mdash;a
<span class="smcap">Marquisate</span>&mdash;at which the earl gazed with the wistful
eye of an old and feeble ape at a cocoa-nut, just above his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
reach, and which he beholds at length grasped and carried
off by some nimbler and younger rival.</p>

<p>Among all the weighty cares and anxieties of this life,
however, I must do the earl the justice to say, that he
did not neglect the concerns of hereafter&mdash;the solemn
realities of that Future revealed to us in the Scriptures.
To his enlightened and comprehensive view of the state
of things around him, it was evident that the Author of
the world had decreed the existence of regular gradations
of society. The following lines, quoted one night in the
House by the leader of his party, had infinitely delighted
the earl&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Oh, where <small>DEGREE</small> is shaken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is the ladder to all high designs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The enterprise is sick!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take but <small>DEGREE</small> away&mdash;untune that string,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, hark! what discord follows! each thing meets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mere oppugnancy!"<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the earl discovered that this was the production of
Shakespeare he conceived a great respect for that writer,
and purchased a copy of his works, and had them splendidly
bound. They were fated never to be opened, however,
except at that one place where the famous passage
in question was to be found. How great was the honor
thus conferred upon the plebeian poet, to stand amid a
collection of royal and noble authors, to whose productions,
and those in elucidation and praise of them, the
earl's splendid-looking library had till then been confined!&mdash;Since,
thought the earl, such is clearly the order of
Providence in this world, why should it not be so in the
next? He felt certain that then there would be found
corresponding differences and degrees, in analogy to the
differences and degrees existing upon earth; and with
this view had read and endeavored to comprehend the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
first page or two of a very dry but learned book&mdash;Butler's
<i>Analogy</i>&mdash;lent him by a deceased kinsman&mdash;a
bishop. This consolatory conclusion of the earl's was
greatly strengthened by a passage of Scripture, from
which he had once heard the aforesaid bishop preach&mdash;"<i>In
my Father's house are</i> <small>MANY MANSIONS</small>; <i>if it had
not been so, I would have told you</i>." On grounds such as
these, after much conversation with several old brother
peers of his own rank, he and they&mdash;those wise and
good men&mdash;came to the conclusion that there was no
real ground for apprehending so grievous a misfortune
as the huddling together hereafter of the great and small
into one miscellaneous and ill-assorted assemblage; but
that the rules of precedence, in all their strictness, as
being founded in the nature of things, would meet with
an exact observance, so that every one should be ultimately
and eternally happy&mdash;in the company of his
equals. The Earl of Dreddlington would have, in fact,
as soon supposed, with the deluded Indian, that in his
voyage to the next world&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His faithful dog should bear him company;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as that his Lordship should be doomed to participate the
same regions of heaven with any of his domestics; unless,
indeed, by some, in his view, not improbable dispensation,
it should form an ingredient in their cup of happiness in
the next world, there to perform those offices&mdash;or analogous
ones&mdash;for their old masters, which they had performed
upon earth. As the earl grew older, these just,
and rational, and Scriptural views, became clearer, and his
faith firmer. Indeed, it might be said that he was in a
manner ripening for immortality&mdash;for which his noble
and lofty nature, he secretly felt, was fitter, and more
likely to be in its element, than it could possibly be in
this dull, degraded, and confused world. He knew that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
there his sufferings in this inferior stage of existence would
be richly recompensed,&mdash;for sufferings indeed he had,
though secret, arising from the scanty means which had
been allotted to him for the purpose of maintaining the exalted
rank to which it had pleased God to call him. The
long series of exquisite mortifications and pinching privations
arising from this inadequacy of means, had, however,
the earl doubted not, been designed by Providence as a
trial of his constancy, and from which he would, in due
time, issue like thrice-refined gold. Then also would
doubtless be remembered in his favor the innumerable
instances of his condescension in mingling, in the most
open and courteous manner, with those who were unquestionably
his inferiors, sacrificing his own feelings of lofty
and fastidious exclusiveness, and endeavoring to advance
the interests, and as far as influence and example went,
polish and refine the manners of the lower orders of society.
Such is an outline&mdash;alas, how faint and imperfect!&mdash;of
the character of this great and good man, the Earl
of Dreddlington. As for his domestic and family circumstances,
he had been a widower for some fifteen years, his
countess having brought him but one child, Lady Cecilia
Philippa Leopoldina Plantagenet, who was, in almost all
respects, the counterpart of her illustrious father. She
resembled him not a little in feature, only that she partook
of the plainness of her mother. Her complexion
was delicately fair; but her features had no other expression
than that of a languid hauteur. Her upper eyelids
drooped as if she could hardly keep them open; the upper
jaw projected considerably over the under one; and
her front teeth were prominent and exposed. Frigid and
inanimate, she seemed to take but little interest in anything
on earth. In person, she was of average height, of
slender and well-proportioned figure, and an erect and
graceful carriage, only that she had a habit of throwing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
her head a little backward, which gave her a singularly
disdainful appearance. She had reached her twenty-seventh
year without having had an eligible offer of marriage,
though she would be the possessor of a barony in
her own right, and £5,000 a-year; a circumstance which,
it may be believed, not a little embittered her. She inherited
her father's pride in all its plenitude. You should
have seen the haughty couple sitting silently side by side
in the old-fashioned yellow family chariot, as they drove
round the crowded park, returning the salutations of those
they met in the slightest manner possible! A glimpse of
them at such a moment would have given you a far more
just and lively notion of their real character, than the
most anxious and labored description of mine.</p>

<p>Ever since the first Earl of Dreddlington had, through
a bitter pique conceived against his eldest son, the second
earl, diverted the principal family revenues to the younger
branch, leaving the title to be supported by only £5,000
a-year, there had been a complete estrangement between
the elder and the younger&mdash;the titled and the moneyed&mdash;branches
of the family. On Mr. Aubrey's attaining his
majority, however, the present earl sanctioned overtures
being made towards a reconciliation, being of opinion that
Mr. Aubrey and Lady Cecilia might, by intermarriage,
effect a happy reunion of family interests; an object, this,
which had long lain nearer his heart than any other upon
earth, till, in fact, it became a kind of passion. Actuated
by such considerations, he had done more to conciliate Mr.
Aubrey than he had ever done towards any one on earth.
It was, however, in vain. Mr. Aubrey's first delinquency
was an unqualified adoption of Tory principles. Now all
the Dreddlingtons, from time whereof the memory of man
runneth not to the contrary, had been firm unflinching
Tories, till the distinguished father of the present earl
quietly walked over, one day, to the other side of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
House of Lords, completely fascinated by a bit of ribbon
which the minister held up before him; and ere he had
sat in that wonder-working region, the ministerial side of
the House, twenty-four hours, he discovered that the true
signification of Tory, was <i>bigot</i>&mdash;and of Whig, <i>patriot</i>;
and he stuck to that version till it transformed him into
a <small>GOLD STICK</small>, in which capacity he died; having repeatedly
and solemnly impressed upon his son, the necessity
and advantage of taking the same view of public affairs,
that so he might arrive at similar results. And in the
<i>way</i> in which he had been <i>trained up</i>, most religiously had
gone the earl; and see the result: he, also, had attained
to eminent and responsible office&mdash;to wit, that of Lord
Steward of the Household. Now, things standing thus&mdash;how
could the earl so compromise his principles, and indirectly
injure his party, as by suffering his daughter to
marry a Tory? Great grief and vexation of spirit did <i>this</i>
matter, therefore, occasion to that excellent nobleman.
But, secondly, Aubrey not only declined to marry his
cousin, but clinched his refusal, and sealed his final exclusion
from the dawning good opinion and affections of
the earl, by marrying, as hath been seen, some one else&mdash;Miss
St. Clair. Thenceforth there was a great gulf between
the Earl of Dreddlington and the Aubreys. Whenever
they happened to meet, the earl greeted him with an
elaborate bow, and a petrifying smile; but for the last
seven years not one syllable had passed between them.
As for Mr. Aubrey, he had never been otherwise than
amused at the eccentric airs of his magnificent kinsman.&mdash;Now,
was it not a hard thing for the earl to bear&mdash;namely,
the prospect there was that his barony and estates
might devolve upon this same Aubrey, or his issue?
for Lady Cecilia, alas! enjoyed but precarious health, and
her chances of marrying seemed daily diminishing. This
was a thorn in the poor earl's flesh; a source of constant
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
<i>worry</i> to him, sleeping and waking; and proud as he was,
and with such good reason, he would have gone down on
his knees and prayed to Heaven to avert so direful a calamity&mdash;to
see his daughter married&mdash;and with a prospect
of perpetuating upon the earth the sublime race of
the Dreddlingtons.</p>

<p>Such being the relative position of Mr. Aubrey, and the
Earl of Dreddlington, at the time when this history opens,
it is easy for the reader to imagine the lively interest with
which the earl first heard of the tidings that a stranger
had set up a title to the whole of the Yatton estates; and
the silent but profound anxiety with which he continued
to regard the progress of the affair. He obtained, from
time to time, by means of confidential inquiries instituted
by his solicitor, a general notion of the nature of the new
claimant's pretensions; but with a due degree of delicacy
towards his unfortunate kinsman, his Lordship studiously
concealed the interest he felt in so important a family
question as the succession to the Yatton property. The
earl and his daughter were exceedingly anxious to <i>see</i> the
claimant; and when he heard that that claimant was a
gentleman of "decided Whig principles"&mdash;the earl was
very near setting it down as a sort of special interference
of Providence in his favor; and one that, in the natural
order of things, would lead to the accomplishment of his
other wishes. Who could say that, before a twelvemonth
had passed over, the two branches of the family might
not be in a fair way of being reunited? And that thus,
among other incidents, the earl would be invested with
the virtual patronage of the borough of Yatton, and, in
the event of their return to power, his claim upon his
party for his long-coveted marquisate rendered irresistible?
He had gone to the Continent shortly before the
trial of the ejectment at York; and did not return till a
day or two after the Court of King's Bench had solemnly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
declared the validity of the plaintiff's title to the Yatton
property, and consequently established his contingent
right of succession to the barony of Drelincourt. Of this
event a lengthened account was given in one of the Yorkshire
papers which fell under the earl's eye the day after
his arrival from abroad; and to the report of the decision
of the question of law, was appended the following
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In consequence of the above decision, Mr. Aubrey, we are
able to state on the best authority, has given formal notice of
his intention to surrender the entire of the Yatton property
without further litigation; thus making the promptest amends
in his power to those whom he has&mdash;we cannot doubt unwittingly&mdash;injured.
He has also accepted the Chiltern Hundreds,
and has consequently retired from Parliament; so that the borough
of Yatton is now vacant. We sincerely hope that the
new proprietor of Yatton will either himself sit for the borough,
and announce immediately his intention of doing so, or give
his prompt and decisive support to some gentleman of decided
Whig principles. We say <i>prompt</i>&mdash;for the enemy is vigilant
and crafty. Men of Yatton! To the rescue!!!&mdash;Mr. Titmouse
is now, we believe, in London. This fortunate gentleman
is not only at this moment in possession of the fine
property at Yatton, with an unencumbered rent-roll of from
twelve to fifteen thousand a-year, and a vast accumulation of
rents to be handed over by the late possessor, but is now next
but one in succession to the earldom of Dreddlington and barony
of Drelincourt, with the large family estates annexed
thereto. We believe this is the oldest barony in the kingdom.
It must be a source of great gratification to the present earl,
to know that his probable successor professes the same liberal
and enlightened political opinions, of which his Lordship has,
during his long and distinguished public life, been so able,
consistent, and uncompromising a supporter."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Earl of Dreddlington was not a little flustered on
seeing the above paragraph; which he read over half a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
dozen times with increasing excitement. The time had at
length arrived for him to take decisive steps; nay, duty
to his newly-discovered kinsman required it.</p>

<p>Messrs. Titmouse and Gammon were walking arm-in-arm
down Oxford Street, on their return from some livery-stables,
where they had been looking at a horse which
Titmouse was thinking of purchasing, when an incident
occurred which ruffled him not a little. He had been recognized
and publicly accosted by a vulgar fellow, with a
yard-measure in his hand, and a large parcel of drapery
under his arm&mdash;in fact, by our old friend Mr. Huckaback.
In vain did Mr. Titmouse affect, for some time,
not to see his old acquaintance, and to be earnestly engaged
in conversation with Mr. Gammon.</p>

<p>"Ah, Titty!&mdash;Titmouse! Well, then&mdash;<i>Mister</i> Titmouse&mdash;how
are you?&mdash;Devilish long time since we
met!" Titmouse directed a look at him which he wished
could have blighted him, and quickened his pace without
taking any further notice of the presumptuous intruder.
Huckaback's blood was up, however&mdash;roused by this ungrateful
and insolent treatment from one who had been
under such great obligations to him; and quickening <i>his</i>
pace also, he kept alongside with Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Ah," continued Huckaback, "why do you cut me in
this way, Titty? You <i>aren't</i> ashamed of me surely?
Many's the time you've tramped up and down Oxford
Street with your bundle and yard-measure"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fellow!" at length exclaimed Titmouse, indignantly,
"'pon my life I'll give you in charge if you go on so!
Be off, you low fellow!&mdash;Dem vulgar brute!" he subjoined
in a lower tone, bursting into perspiration, for he
had not forgotten the insolent pertinacity of Huckaback's
disposition.</p>

<p>"My eyes! Give me in charge? Come, I like that,
rather&mdash;you vagabond! Pay me what you owe me!
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
You're a swindler! You owe me fifty pounds, you do!
You sent a man to rob me!"</p>

<p>"Will any one get a constable!" inquired Titmouse,
who had grown as white as death. The little crowd that
was collecting round them began to suspect, from Titmouse's
agitated appearance, that there must be some
foundation for the charges made against him.</p>

<p>"Oh, go, get a constable! Nothing I should like better!
Ah, my fine gentleman&mdash;what's the time of day when
chaps like you are wound up so high?"</p>

<p>Gammon's interference was in vain. Huckaback got
more abusive and noisy; no constable was at hand; so,
to escape the intolerable interruption and nuisance, he
beckoned a coach off the stand, which was close by; and,
Titmouse and he stepping into it, they were soon out of
sight and hearing of Mr. Huckaback. Having taken a
shilling drive, they alighted, and walked towards Covent
Garden. As they approached the hotel, they observed a
yellow chariot, at once elegant and somewhat old-fashioned,
rolling away from the door.</p>

<p>"I wonder who that is," said Gammon; "it's an earl's
coronet on the panel; and a white-haired old gentleman
was sitting low down in the corner"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;it's no doubt a fine thing to be a lord, and all
that&mdash;but I'll answer for it, some of 'em's as poor as a
church mouse," replied Titmouse as they entered the hotel.
At that moment the waiter, with a most profound bow,
presented him with a letter and a card, which had only the
moment before been left for him. The card was thus:</p>

<table border="1">
 <colgroup>
  <col width="280" />
 </colgroup>
   <tr>
    <td>
     <p align="center"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE EARL OF DREDDLINGTON. </p>
     <br />
     <br />
     <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:0.8em"> GROSVENOR SQUARE </span></p>
    </td>
   </tr>
</table>

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>

<p>and there was written on it, in pencil, in rather a feeble
and hurried character&mdash;"For Mr. Titmouse."</p>

<p>"My stars, Mr. Gammon!" exclaimed Titmouse, excitedly,
addressing Mr. Gammon, who also seemed greatly
interested by the occurrence. They both repaired to a
vacant table at the extremity of the room; and Titmouse,
with not a little trepidation, hastily breaking a large seal
which bore the earl's family arms, with their crowded
quarterings and grim supporters&mdash;better appreciated by
Gammon, however, than by Titmouse&mdash;opened the ample
envelope, and, unfolding its thick gilt-edged enclosure,
read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Earl of Dreddlington has the honor of waiting upon
Mr. Titmouse, in whom he is very happy to have, though unexpectedly,
discovered so near a kinsman. On the event which
has brought this to pass, the earl congratulates himself not
less than Mr. Titmouse, and hopes for the earliest opportunity
of a personal introduction.</p>

<p>"The earl leaves town to-day and will not return till Monday
next, on which day he begs the honor of Mr. Titmouse's
company to dinner, at six o'clock. He may depend upon its
being strictly a family <i>reunion</i>; the only person present, besides
Mr. Titmouse and the earl, being the Lady Cecilia.</p>

<div align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grosvenor Square, Thursday. </div>
<div align="left"> "<span class="smcap">Tittlebat Titmouse, Esq.</span>, &amp;c. &amp;c." </div>
</blockquote>

<p>As soon as Titmouse had read the above, still holding
it in his hand, he gazed at Gammon with mute apprehension
and delight. Of the existence, indeed, of the
magnificent personage who had just introduced himself,
Titmouse had certainly heard, from time to time, since
the commencement of the proceedings which had just
been so successfully terminated. He had seen the brightness,
to be sure; but, as a sort of remote splendor, like
that of a fixed star which gleamed brightly, but at too
vast a distance to have any sensible influence, or even to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
arrest his attention. After a little while, Titmouse began
to chatter very volubly; but Gammon, after reading over
the note once or twice, seemed not much inclined for
conversation: and, had Titmouse been accustomed to observation,
he might have gathered, from the eye and brow
of Gammon, that that gentleman's mind was very deeply
occupied by some matter or other, probably suggested by
the incident which had just taken place. Titmouse, by-and-by,
called for pens, ink, and paper&mdash;"the very best
gilt-edged paper, mind"&mdash;and prepared to reply to Lord
Dreddlington's invitation. Gammon, however, who knew
the peculiarities of his friend's style of correspondence,
suggested that <i>he</i> should draw up, and Titmouse copy
the following note. This was presently done; but when
Gammon observed how thickly studded it was with capital
letters, the numerous flourishes with which it was
garnished, and its more than questionable orthography,
he prevailed on Titmouse, after some little difficulty, to
allow him to transcribe the note which was to be sent to
Lord Dreddlington. Here is a copy of that courteous
document:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Titmouse begs to present his compliments to the Earl
of Dreddlington, and to express the high sense he entertains
of the kind consideration evinced by his Lordship in his call
and note of to-day.</p>

<p>"One of the most gratifying circumstances connected with
Mr. Titmouse's recent success, is the distinguished alliance
which his Lordship has been so prompt and courteous in recognizing.
Mr. Titmouse will feel the greatest pleasure in
availing himself of the Earl of Dreddlington's invitation to
dinner for Monday next.</p>

<div align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cabbage-Stalk Hotel, Thursday. </div>
<div align="left">  "The Right Honble. the <span class="smcap">Earl of Dreddlington</span>, &amp;c., &amp;c." </div>
</blockquote>

<p>"Have you a 'Peerage' here, waiter?" inquired Gammon,
as the waiter brought him a lighted taper. <i>Debrett</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
was shortly laid before him; and turning to the name of
Dreddlington, he read over the paragraph which had been
already laid before the reader. "Humph&mdash;<i>'Lady Cecilia'</i>&mdash;here
she is&mdash;his <i>daughter</i>&mdash;I thought as much&mdash;I
see!" This was what passed through his mind, as&mdash;having
left Titmouse, who set off to deposit a card and
the above "Answer" at Lord Dreddlington's&mdash;he made
his way towards the delectable regions in which their office
was situated&mdash;Saffron Hill. "'Tis curious&mdash;amusing&mdash;interesting,
to observe the social progress of this charming
little fellow"&mdash;continued Gammon to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Tag-rag</i>&mdash;and his daughter;</p>

<p>"<i>Quirk</i>&mdash;and his daughter;</p>

<p>"<i>The Earl of Dreddlington</i>&mdash;and his daughter. How
many more? Happy! happy! happy Titmouse!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sun which was rising upon Titmouse was setting
upon the Aubreys. Dear, delightful&mdash;now too dear,
now too delightful&mdash;Yatton! the shades of evening are
descending upon thee, and thy virtuous but afflicted occupants,
who, early on the morrow, quit thee forever.
Approach silently you conservatory. Behold, in the midst
of it, the dark slight figure of a lady, solitary, motionless,
in melancholy attitude&mdash;her hands clasped before her:
it is Miss Aubrey. Her face is beautiful, but grief is in
her eye; and her bosom heaves with sighs, which, gentle
though they be, are yet the only sounds audible. Yes,
that is the sweet and once joyous Kate Aubrey!</p>

<p>'Twas she indeed; and this was her last visit to her
conservatory. Many rare, delicate, and beautiful flowers
were there. The air was laden with the fragrant odors
which they exhaled, as it were in sighs, on account of
the dreaded departure of their lovely mistress. At length
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
she stooped down, and, in stooping, a tear fell right upon
the small sprig of geranium which she gently detached
from its stem, and placed in her bosom. "Sweet flowers,"
thought she, "who will tend you as I have tended you,
when I am gone? Why do you look now more beautiful
than ever you did before?"&mdash;Her eye presently fell upon
the spot on which, till the day before, had stood her aviary.
Poor Kate had sent it, as a present, to Lady De la Zouch,
and it was then at Fotheringham Castle. What a flutter
there used to be among the beautiful little creatures,
when they perceived Kate's approach! She turned her
head away. She felt oppressed, and attributed it to the
closeness of the conservatory&mdash;the strength of the odors
given out by the numerous flowers; but it was sorrow
that oppressed her; and she was in a state at once of
mental excitement and physical exhaustion. The last few
weeks had been an interval of exquisite suffering. She
could not be happy alone, nor yet bear the company of
her brother and sister-in-law, or their innocent and lovely
children. Quitting the conservatory with a look of lingering
fondness, she passed along into the house with a hurried
step, and escaped, unobserved, to her chamber&mdash;the
very chamber in which the reader obtained his first distant
and shadowy glimpse of her; and in which, now
entering it silently and suddenly, the door being only
closed, not shut, she observed her faithful little maid
Harriet, sitting in tears before a melancholy heap of
packages prepared for travelling on the morrow. She
rose as Miss Aubrey entered, and presently exclaimed
passionately, bursting afresh into tears, "Ma'am, I <i>can't</i>
leave you&mdash;indeed I can't! I know all your ways; I
won't go to any one else! I shall hate service! and I
know they'll hate <i>me</i> too; for I shall cry myself to
death!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Harriet," faltered Miss Aubrey, "this is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
very foolish; nay, it is unkind to distress me in this
manner at the last moment."</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am, if you <i>did</i> but know how I love you!
How I'd go on my knees to serve you all the rest of the
days of my life!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk in that way, Harriet; that's a good girl,"
said Miss Aubrey, rather faintly, and, sinking into the
chair, she buried her face in her handkerchief, "you
know I've had a great deal to go through, Harriet, and
am in very poor spirits."</p>

<p>"I know it, ma'am, I do; and that's why I can't <i>bear</i>
to leave you!" She sank on her knees beside Miss Aubrey.
"Oh, ma'am, if you would but let me stay with
you! I've been trying, ever since you first told me, to
make up my mind to part with you, and, now it's coming
to the time, I <i>can't</i>, ma'am&mdash;indeed, I can't! If you did
but know, ma'am, what my thoughts have been, while
I've been folding and packing up your dresses here! To
think that I sha'n't be with you to unpack them! It's
very hard, ma'am, that Madam's maid is to go with her,
and I'm not to go with <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>"We were obliged to make a choice, Harriet," said Miss
Aubrey, with forced calmness.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; but why didn't you choose us both?
Because we've both always done our best; and, as for
me, you've never spoke an unkind word to me in your
life"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Harriet, Harriet," said Miss Aubrey, tremulously,
"I've several times explained to you that we cannot any
longer afford each to have our own maid; and Mrs. Aubrey's
maid is older than you, and knows how to manage
children"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What signifies <i>affording</i>, ma'am? Neither she nor I
will ever take a shilling of wages; I'd really rather serve
you for nothing, ma'am, than any other lady for a hundred
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
pounds a-year! Oh, so happy as I've been in your
service, ma'am!" she added hastily, and burst into an
agony of weeping.</p>

<p>"Don't, Harriet!&mdash;You would not, if you knew the
pain you give me," said Miss Aubrey, faintly. Harriet
perceived Miss Aubrey's ill-concealed agitation; and starting
aside, poured out a glass of water, and forced her pale
mistress to swallow a little, which presently revived her.</p>

<p>"Harriet," said she, feebly, but firmly, "you have never
once disobeyed me, and <i>now</i> I am certain that you will
not. I assure you that we have made all our arrangements,
and cannot alter them. I have been very fortunate
in obtaining for you so kind a mistress as Lady
Stratton. Remember, Harriet, she was the oldest bosom
friend of my"&mdash;&mdash;Miss Aubrey's voice trembled, and she
ceased speaking for a minute or two, during which she
struggled against her feelings with momentary success.
"Here's the prayer-book," she presently resumed, opening
a drawer in her dressing-table, and taking out a small
volume&mdash;"Here's the prayer-book I promised you; it
is very prettily bound, and I have written your name in
it, Harriet, as you desired. Take it, and keep it for my
sake. Will you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am," replied the girl, bitterly, "I shall never
bear to look at it! And yet I'll never part with it till
I die!"</p>

<p>"Now leave me, Harriet, for a short time&mdash;I wish to
be alone," said Miss Aubrey; and she was obeyed. She
presently rose and bolted the door; and then, secure from
interruption, walked slowly to and fro for some time; and
a long and deep current of melancholy thoughts and feelings
flowed through her mind and heart. She had but a
short time before seen her sister's sweet children put into
their little beds for the last time at Yatton; and together
with their mother, had hung fondly over them, kissing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and embracing them&mdash;their destined little fellow-wanderers&mdash;till
her feelings compelled her to leave them.
One by one, all the dear innumerable ties which had attached
her to Yatton, and to everything connected with
it, ever since her birth, had been severed and broken&mdash;ties,
not only the strength, but very existence of which,
she had scarce been aware of, till then. She had bade&mdash;as
had all of them&mdash;repeated and agonizing farewells
to very dear and old friends. Her heart trembled as she
gazed at the objects familiar to her eye, and pregnant with
innumerable little softening associations, ever since her
infancy. Nothing around them now belonged to <i>them</i>&mdash;but
to a stranger&mdash;to one who&mdash;she shuddered with
disgust. She thought of the fearful position in which her
brother was placed&mdash;entirely at the mercy of, it might
be, selfish and rapacious men&mdash;what indeed was to become
of all of them? At length she threw herself into
the large old easy-chair which stood near the window, and
with a fluttering heart and hasty tremulous hand, drew
an open letter from her bosom. She held it for some
moments, as if dreading again to peruse it&mdash;but at length
unfolded and read a portion of it. 'Twas full of fervent
and at the same time delicate expressions of fondness;
and after a short while, her hand dropped, with the letter,
upon her lap, and she burst into a passionate flood of
tears. After an interval of several minutes, she again
took up the letter&mdash;read a little farther&mdash;still more and
more moved by the generous and noble sentiments it
contained&mdash;and at length, utterly overcome, she again
dropped her hand, and sobbed aloud long and vehemently.
"It cannot&mdash;cannot&mdash;no, it <i>cannot</i> be," she murmured;
and, yielding to her feelings for a long while, her tears
showered down her pallid, beautiful cheeks.</p>

<p>At length, having resumed her perusal of the letter, she
came to the conclusion. In a kind of agony she pressed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the signature to her lips; and then hastily folding up the
letter, replaced it whence she had taken it, and continued
sobbing bitterly. Alas, what additional poignancy did
this give to the agonies of her last evening at Yatton!
She had, however, become somewhat calmer by the time
that she heard the door hastily, but gently tapped at, and
then attempted to be opened. Miss Aubrey rose and unbolted
it, and Mrs. Aubrey entered, her beautiful countenance
as pale and sad as that of her sister-in-law. The
former, however, was both wife and mother; and the
various cares which these relations had entailed upon
her, at a bitter moment like the present, served in some
measure to occupy her thoughts, and prevent her from
being absorbed by the heart-breaking circumstances which
surrounded her. Suffering had, however, a little impaired
her beauty; her cheek was very pale, and her eye and
brow were laden with trouble.</p>

<p>"Kate, dear Kate," said she, rather quickly, closing
the door after her, "what is to be done? Did you hear
carriage-wheels a few moments ago? Who do you think
have arrived? As I fancied would be the case, the De
la Zouches!" Miss Aubrey trembled and turned pale.
"You must see&mdash;you <i>must</i> see&mdash;Lady De la Zouch, Kate&mdash;they
have driven from Fotheringham on purpose to
take&mdash;<i>once more</i>&mdash;a last farewell! 'Tis very painful,
but what can be done? You know what dear, dear, good
friends they are!"</p>

<p>"Is Lord De la Zouch come, also?" inquired Miss
Aubrey, apprehensively.</p>

<p>"I will not deceive you, dearest Kate, they are <i>all</i>
come; but <i>she</i>, only, is in the house: they are gone out
to look for Charles, who is walking in the park." Miss
Aubrey trembled violently; and after evidently a severe
struggle with her feelings, the color having entirely deserted
her face, and left it of an ashy whiteness, "I cannot
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
muster up resolution enough, Agnes," she whispered.
"I know their errand!"</p>

<p>"Care not about their errand, love!" said Mrs. Aubrey,
embracing her fondly. "You shall not be troubled&mdash;you
shall not be persecuted." Miss Aubrey shook her head,
and grasped Mrs. Aubrey's hand.</p>

<p>"They do not, Agnes, they <i>cannot</i> persecute me," replied
Miss Aubrey, with energy. "It is a cruel and harsh
word to use&mdash;and!&mdash;consider how noble, how disinterested
is their conduct; <i>that</i> it is which subdues me!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Aubrey embraced still more closely her agitated
sister-in-law, and tenderly kissed her forehead.</p>

<p>"Oh, Agnes!" faltered Miss Aubrey, pressing her hand
upon her heart to relieve the intolerable oppression which
she suffered&mdash;"would to Heaven that I had never seen&mdash;never
thought of him!"</p>

<p>"Don't fear, Kate! that he will attempt to see you on
so sad an occasion as this. Delamere is a man of infinite
delicacy and generosity!"</p>

<p>"I know he is&mdash;I know he is," gasped Miss Aubrey,
almost suffocated with her emotions.</p>

<p>"Stay, I'll tell you what to do; I'll go down and return
with Lady De la Zouch: we can see her here, undisturbed
and alone, for a few moments; and then, nothing
painful <i>can</i> occur. Shall I bring her?" she inquired, rising.
Miss Aubrey did not dissent; and, within a very
few minutes' time, Mrs. Aubrey returned, accompanied
by Lady De la Zouch. She was rather an elderly woman.
Her countenance was still handsome; and she possessed a
very dignified carriage. She was of an extremely affectionate
disposition, and passionately fond of Miss Aubrey.
Hastily drawing aside her veil as she entered the room,
she stepped quickly up to Miss Aubrey, kissed her, and
grasped her hands, for some moments, in silence.</p>

<p>"This is very sad work, Miss Aubrey," said she at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
length, hurriedly glancing at the luggage lying piled up
at the other end of the room. Miss Aubrey made no
answer, but shook her head. "It was useless attempting
it, dear Kate&mdash;we <i>could</i> not stay at home; we have risked
being charged with cruel intrusion; forgive me, dearest,
will you? <i>They</i>," said Lady De la Zouch, pointedly, "will
not come near you!" Miss Aubrey trembled. "I feel as
if I were parting with an only daughter, Kate," said Lady
De la Zouch, with sudden emotion. "How your mamma
and I loved one another!" said she, fondly, and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, open the window; I feel suffocated,"
faltered Miss Aubrey. Mrs. Aubrey hastily drew up the
window, and the cool refreshing breeze of evening quickly
diffused itself through the apartment, and revived the
drooping spirits of Miss Aubrey, who walked gently to
and fro about the room, supported by Lady De la Zouch
and Mrs. Aubrey, and soon recovered a tolerable degree of
composure. The three ladies presently stood, arm-in-arm,
gazing through the deep bay-window at the fine prospect
which it commanded. The gloom of evening was beginning
to steal over the landscape.</p>

<p>"How beautiful!" exclaimed Miss Aubrey, faintly, with
a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"The window in the northern tower of the Castle commands
a still more extensive view," said Lady De la Zouch,
looking earnestly at Miss Aubrey, who, as if conscious of
some agitating allusion, burst into tears. After standing
gazing through the window for some time longer, they
stepped back into the room, and were soon engaged in
deep and earnest conversation.</p>

<p>For the last three weeks Mr. Aubrey had addressed
himself with calmness and energy to the painful duties
which had devolved upon him, of <i>setting his house in order</i>.
Immediately after quitting the dinner-table that day&mdash;a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
mere nominal meal to all of them&mdash;he had retired to the
library, to complete the extensive and important arrangements
consequent upon his abandonment of Yatton; and
after about an hour thus occupied, he went forth to take
a solitary walk&mdash;a melancholy&mdash;a last walk about the
property. It was a moment which severely tried his fortitude;
but that fortitude stood the trial. He was a man
of lively sensibilities, and appreciated, to its utmost extent,
the melancholy and alarming change which had come over
his fortunes. Surely even the bluntest and coarsest feelings
which ever tried to disguise and dignify themselves
under the name of <small>STOICISM</small>&mdash;to convert into bravery,
and fortitude, a stupid, sullen insensibility&mdash;must have
been not a little shaken by such scenes as Mr. Aubrey
had had to pass through during the last few weeks&mdash;scenes
which I do not choose to distress the reader's feelings
by dwelling upon in detail. Mr. Aubrey had no mean
pretensions to real philosophy; but he had still juster pretensions
to an infinitely higher character,&mdash;that of a
<span class="smcap">Christian</span>. He had a firm unwavering conviction that
whatever befell him, either of good or evil, was by the
ordination of the Almighty&mdash;infinitely Wise, infinitely
Good;&mdash;and this was the source of his fortitude and
resignation. He felt himself here standing upon ground
which was immovable.</p>

<p>To avert the misfortune which menaced him, he had
neglected no rational and <i>conscientious</i> means. To retain
the advantages of fortune and station to which he had
believed himself born, he had made the most strenuous
exertions consistent with a rigid sense of honor. What,
indeed, <i>could</i> he have done, that he <i>had</i> not done? He
had caused the claims of his opponent to be subjected to
as severe a scrutiny as the wit of man could suggest; <i>and
they had stood the test</i>. Those claims, and his own, had
been each of them placed in the scales of justice; those
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
scales had been held up and poised by the pure and firm
hands to which the laws of God, and of the country, had
committed the administration of justice: on what ground
could a just and reasonable man quarrel with or repine
at the issue? And supposing that a perverse and subtle
ingenuity in his legal advisers could have devised means
for delaying his surrender of the property to the individual
who had been solemnly declared its true owner, what
real and ultimate advantage could have been obtained by
such a dishonorable line of conduct? Could the spirit of
the <span class="smcap">Christian religion</span> tolerate the bare idea of it? Could
such purposes or intentions consist for one instant with
the consciousness that the awful eye of God was always
upon every thought of his mind, every feeling of his heart,
every purpose of his will? A thorough and lively conviction
of God's moral government of the world secured
Aubrey a happy composure&mdash;a glorious and immovable
resolution. It enabled him to form a true estimate of
things; it extracted the sting from grief and regret; it
dispelled the gloom which would otherwise have settled
portentously upon the future. Thus he had not <i>forgotten
the exhortation which spoke unto him, as unto a child: My
son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint
when thou art rebuked of him</i>. And if, indeed, religion
had not done this for Mr. Aubrey, what <i>could</i> it have
done, what would it have been worth? It would indeed
have been that which dull fools suppose it&mdash;a mere name,
a melancholy delusion. What hopeless and lamentable
imbecility would it not have argued, to have acknowledged
the reality and influence of religion in the hour of prosperity&mdash;and
to have doubted, distrusted, or denied it in
the hour of adversity? When a child beholds the sun
obscured by dark clouds, he may think in his simplicity
that it is gone forever; but a <small>MAN</small> knows that behind is
the sun, magnificent as ever; and that the next moment,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the clouds having rolled away, its glorious warmth and
light are again upon the earth. Thus is it, thought Aubrey
with humble but cheerful confidence, with the Almighty&mdash;who
hath declared himself <i>the Father of the
spirits of all flesh</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Behind a frowning Providence<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He hides a smiling face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blind unbelief is sure to err,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And scan His works in vain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God is His own interpreter,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And He will make it plain!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Therefore, O my God!" thought Aubrey, as he gazed
upon the lovely scenes familiar to him from his birth,
and from which a few short hours were to separate him
forever, "I do acknowledge Thy hand in what has befallen
me, and Thy mercy which enables me to bear it,
as from Thee." The scene around him was tranquil and
beautiful&mdash;inexpressibly beautiful. He stood under the
shadow of a mighty elm-tree, the last of a long and noble
avenue, which he had been pacing in deep thought for upwards
of an hour. The ground was considerably elevated
above the level of the rest of the park. No sound disturbed
the serene repose of the approaching evening, except
the distant and gradually diminishing sounds issuing
from an old rookery, and the faint low bubbling of a clear
streamlet which flowed not far from where he stood. Here
and there, under the deepening shadows cast by the lofty
trees, might be seen the glancing forms of deer, the only
live things visible. "Life," said Aubrey, to himself, with
a sigh, as he leaned against the trunk of the grand old
tree under which he stood, and gazed with a fond and
mournful eye on the lovely scenes stretching before him,
to which the subdued radiance of the departing sunlight
communicated a tone of tender pensiveness; "life is, in
truth, what the Scripture&mdash;what the voice of nature&mdash;represents
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
it&mdash;a long journey, during which the traveller
stops at many resting places. Some of them are more,
others less beautiful; from some he parts with more, from
others with less regret; but <i>part he must</i>, and pursue his
journey, though he may often turn back to gaze with lingering
fondness and admiration at the scene which he has
last quitted. The next stage may be&mdash;<i>as all his journey
might have been</i>&mdash;bleak and desolate; but, through
<i>that</i> he is only passing: he will not be condemned to stay
in it, as he was not permitted to dwell in the other; he
is still journeying on, along a route which he cannot mistake,
to the point of his destination, his journey's end&mdash;the
shores of the vast, immeasurable, boundless ocean of
eternity&mdash;<small>HIS HOME</small>!"</p>

<p>The deepening shadows of evening warned him to retrace
his steps to the Hall. Before quitting the spot upon
which he had been so long standing, he turned his head
a little towards the right, to take a last view of an object
which called forth tender and painful feeling&mdash;it was the
old sycamore which his sister's intercession had saved from
the axe. There it stood, feeble and venerable object! its
leafless silvery-gray branches becoming in the fading light,
dim and indistinct, yet contrasting touchingly with the
verdant strength of those near it. A neat strong fence
had been placed around it; but how much longer would
it receive such care and attention? Aubrey thought of
the comparison which had on a former occasion been made
by his sister; and sighed heavily as he looked his last at
the old tree. Then he slowly walked on towards the Hall.
When about halfway down the avenue, he beheld two figures
apparently approaching him, but undistinguishable
in the gloom and the distance. As they neared him, he recognized
Lord De la Zouch, and Mr. Delamere. Suspecting
the object of their visit, which a little surprised him,
since they had taken a final leave, and a very affecting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
one, the day before, he felt a little anxiety and embarrassment.
Nor was he entirely mistaken. Lord De la
Zouch, who advanced alone towards Aubrey&mdash;Mr. Delamere
turning back&mdash;most seriously pressed his son's suit
for the hand of Miss Aubrey, as he had often done before;
declaring, that though undoubtedly he wished a year or
two first to elapse, during which his son might complete
his studies at Oxford, there was no object dearer to the
heart of Lady De la Zouch and himself, than to see Miss
Aubrey become their daughter-in-law. "Where," said
Lord De la Zouch, with much energy, "is he to look elsewhere
for such an union of beauty, of accomplishments,
of amiability, of high-mindedness?" After a great deal
of animated conversation on this subject, during which
Mr. Aubrey assured Lord De la Zouch that <i>he</i> would say
everything which he honorably could to induce his sister
to entertain, or at all events, not to discard the suit of
Delamere; at the same time reminding him of the firmness
of her character, and the hopelessness of attempting
to change any determination to which she might have
been led by her sense of delicacy and honor,&mdash;Lord De
la Zouch addressed himself in a very earnest manner to
matters more immediately relating to the personal interests
of Mr. Aubrey; entered with lively anxiety into all his
future plans and purposes; and once more pressed upon
him the acceptance of most munificent offers of pecuniary
assistance, which, with many fervent expressions of gratitude,
Aubrey again declined. But he pledged himself to
communicate freely with Lord De la Zouch, in the event
of an occasion arising for such assistance as his Lordship
had already so generously volunteered. By this time Mr.
Delamere had joined them, regarding Mr. Aubrey with
infinite earnestness and apprehension. All, however, he
said, was&mdash;and in a hurried manner to his father&mdash;"My
mother is waiting for you in the carriage, and wishes that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
we should immediately return." Lord De la Zouch and
his son again took leave of Mr. Aubrey. "Remember,
my dear Aubrey, remember the pledges you have repeated
this evening," said the former. "I do, I will!" replied
Mr. Aubrey, as they each wrung his hands; and then,
having grasped those of Lady De la Zouch, who sat within
the carriage powerfully affected, the door was shut; and
they were quickly borne away from the presence and the
residence of their afflicted friends. While Mr. Aubrey
stood gazing after them, with folded arms, in an attitude of
melancholy abstraction, at the Hall door, he was accosted
by Dr. Tatham, who had come to him from the library,
where he had been, till a short time before, busily engaged
reducing into writing various matters which had been the
subject of conversation between himself and Mr. Aubrey
during the day.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, my dear friend," said the doctor, "that
there is a painful but interesting scene awaiting you.
You will not, I am sure, forbear to gratify, by your momentary
presence in the servants' hall, a body of your
tenantry, who are there assembled, having come to pay
you&mdash;good souls!&mdash;their parting respects."</p>

<p>"I would really rather be spared the painful scene,"
said Mr. Aubrey, with emotion. "I am nearly unnerved
as it is! Cannot you bid them adieu, in my name? and
say God bless them!"</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> come, my dear friend! If it <i>be</i> painful, it
will be but for a moment; and the recollection of their
hearty and humble expressions of affection and respect
will be pleasant hereafter. Poor souls!" he added with
not a little emotion, "you should see how crowded is
Mr. Griffiths' room with the presents they have each
brought you, and which would surely keep your whole
establishment for months!&mdash;Cheeses, tongues, hams, bacon,
and I know not what beside!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, Doctor," said Mr. Aubrey, quickly, and with
evidently a great effort, "I will see them, my humble and
worthy friends! if it <i>be</i> but for a moment; but I would
rather have been spared the scene." He followed Dr.
Tatham into the spacious servants' hall, which he found
nearly filled by some forty or fifty of his late tenantry,
who, as he entered, rose in troubled silence to receive
him. There were lights, by which a hurried glance sufficed
to show him the deep sorrow visible in their countenances.
"Well, sir," commenced one of them, after a
moment's hesitation&mdash;he seemed to have been chosen
the spokesman of those present&mdash;"we've come to tak'
our leave; and a sad time it be for all of us, and it may
be, sir, for you." He paused, and added abruptly&mdash;"I
thought I could have said a word or two, sir, in the name
of all of us, but I've clean forgotten all; and I wish we
could all forget that we were come to part with you,
sir;&mdash;but we sha'n't&mdash;no, never!&mdash;we shall never
see your like again, sir! God help you, sir!" Again
he paused, and struggled hard to conceal his emotions.
Then he tried to say something further, but his voice
failed him.</p>

<p>"Squire, it may be law; but it be not justice, we all
do think, that hath taken Yatton from you, that was
born to it," said one, who stood next to him who had first
spoken. "Who ever heard o' a scratch in a bit of paper
signifying the loss o' so much? It never were heard of
afore, sir, an' cannot be right!"</p>

<p>"You'll forgive me, Squire," said another, "but we
shall never tak' to t'new one that's coming after you!"</p>

<p>"My worthy&mdash;my dear friends," commenced Mr. Aubrey,
with melancholy and forced composure, as he stood
beside Dr. Tatham, "this is a sad trial to me&mdash;one which
I had not expected, and am quite unprepared for. I
have had lately to go through many very painful scenes;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
but few more so than the present. My dear friends, I
can only say from my heart, God bless you all! I shall
never forget you, whom I have always respected, and indeed
been very proud of, as my tenantry, and whom I
now, of course, look at as my friends only. We shall
<i>never</i> forget you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord Almighty bless you, sir, and Madam and Miss,
and little Miss&mdash;and the little squire!" said a voice,
in a vehement manner, from amid the throng, in tones
which went to Mr. Aubrey's heart. His lips quivered,
and he ceased speaking for some moments. At length
he resumed.</p>

<p>"You see my feelings are a little shaken by the sufferings
which I have gone through. I have only a word
more to say to you. Providence has seen fit, my friends,
to deprive me of that which I had deemed to be my birthright.
God is good and wise; and I bow, as we must all
bow, to His will with reverence and resignation. And
also, my dear friends, let us always submit cheerfully to
the laws under which we live. We must not quarrel
with their decision, merely because it happens to be
adverse to our own wishes. I, from my heart&mdash;and so
must you, from yours&mdash;acknowledge a firm, unshaken
allegiance to the laws; they are ordained by God, and
He demands our obedience to them! society cannot exist
without them"&mdash;He paused. "I have to thank you," he
presently added in a subdued tone, "my worthy friends,
for many substantial tokens of your good-will, brought
with you this evening. I assure you sincerely that I
value them far more"&mdash;he paused, and it was some moments
before he could proceed&mdash;"than if they had been
of the most costly and splendid description"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord, only hearken to t'squire!" called out a voice,
as if on an impulse of eager affection, which its rough,
honest speaker could not resist. This seemed entirely to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
deprive Mr. Aubrey of the power of utterance, and he
turned suddenly towards Dr. Tatham with an overflowing
eye and a convulsive quivering of the lips which showed
the powerful emotions with which he was contending.
The next moment he stepped forward and shook hands
with those nearest. He was quickly surrounded, and
every one present grasped his hands, scarcely any of
them able to utter more than a brief but fervent "God
bless you, sir!"</p>

<p>"I am sure, my friends," said Dr. Tatham, almost as
much affected as any of them, "that you cannot wish to
prolong so afflicting a scene as this. Mr. Aubrey is much
exhausted, and has a long journey to take early in the
morning&mdash;and you had better now leave."</p>

<p>"Farewell! farewell, my kind and dear friends, farewell!&mdash;May
God bless you all, and all your families!"
said Mr. Aubrey; and, most powerfully affected, withdrew
from a scene which he was not likely ever to forget. He
retired, accompanied by Dr. Tatham, to his library; where
Mr. Griffiths, his steward, was in readiness to receive his
signature to various documents. This done, the steward,
after a few hurried expressions of affection and respect,
withdrew; and Mr. Aubrey had then completed all the
arrangements, and transacted all the business, which had
required his attention before quitting Yatton: which, at
an early hour in the morning, he was going to leave;
having determined to go direct to London, instead of accepting
any of the numerous offers which he had received
from his friends in the neighborhood, to take up with
them his abode for, at all events, some considerable period.
That, however, would have been entirely inconsistent
with the plans for his future life, which he had formed
and matured. He left the whole estate in admirable
order and condition. There was not a farm vacant, not
a tenant dissatisfied with the terms under which he held.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Every document, all the accounts connected with the estate,
after having been carefully examined by Mr. Parkinson,
and Mr. Aubrey, and Mr. Griffiths, were in readiness
for the most scrupulous and searching investigation on the
part of Mr. Aubrey's successor and his agents.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey's library was already carefully packed up,
and was to follow him, on the ensuing day, to London, by
water, as also were several portions of the furniture&mdash;the
residue of which was to be sold off within a day or two's
time. How difficult&mdash;how very difficult had it been for
them to choose which articles they would part with, and
which retain! The favorite old high-backed easy-chair,
which had been worked by Miss Aubrey herself; the beautiful
ebony cabinet, which had been given by her father to
her mother, who had given it to Kate; the little chairs of
Charles and Agnes&mdash;and in which Mr. Aubrey and Kate,
and all their brothers and sisters&mdash;long since deceased&mdash;had
sat when children; Mrs. Aubrey's piano; these, and
a few other articles, had been successfully pleaded for
by Mrs. Aubrey and Kate, and were to accompany or
rather follow them to London, instead of passing, by the
auctioneer's hammer, into the hands of strangers. The
two carriage-horses, which had drawn old Mrs. Aubrey in
the family coach for many years, were to be turned to
grass, for the rest of their days, at Lady Stratton's. Poor
old Peggy was, in like manner, to have to herself a little
field belonging to Dr. Tatham. Little Charles's pony, a
beautiful animal, and most reluctantly parted with, was
sent as a present, in his name, to little Sir Harry Oldfield,
one of his play-fellows. Hector, the magnificent Newfoundland
dog, was, at the vehement instance of Pumpkin,
the gardener, who had almost gone upon his knees to
beg for the animal, and declared that he loved the creature
like a son&mdash;as I verily believe he did, for they were
inseparable, and their attachment was mutual&mdash;given up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to him, on his solemn promise to take great care of him.
Then there was a poor animal which they hardly knew
how to dispose of. It was a fine old favorite staghound,
stone-blind, quite gray about the head, and so very feeble,
that it could but just crawl in and out of its commodious
kennel, and lie basking in the genial sunshine; wagging
its tail when any one spoke to it, and affectionately licking
the hand that patted it. Thus had it treated Mr. Aubrey,
that very morning, as he stood by, and stooped down to
caress it for the last time. It was, at his earnest request,
assigned to Dr. Tatham, kennel and all; indeed
the worthy little doctor would have crammed the whole
of his little premises in a similar way, in order to have
the more "keepsakes" and "memorials" of his friends.
Miss Aubrey's beautiful Blenheim spaniel, with its brilliant
black eyes, and long glossy graceful ears, was to accompany
her to London.</p>

<p>As for the servants&mdash;the housekeeper was going to
keep the house of her brother, a widower, at Grilston,
and the butler was going to marry, and quit service. As
for the rest, Mr. Parkinson had, at Mr. Aubrey's desire,
written about them to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap; and Mr. Gammon had sent word that such members
of the establishment as chose, might continue at
Yatton, at all events till the pleasure of Mr. Titmouse,
upon the subject, should have been known. All the
servants had received a quarter's wages that morning
from Mr. Griffiths, in the presence of Mr. Aubrey, who
spoke kindly to each, and earnestly recommended them
to conduct themselves respectfully towards his successor.
Scarce any of them could answer him, otherwise than by
an humble bow, or courtesy, accompanied by sobs and tears.
One of them did contrive to speak, and passionately expressed
a wish that the first morsel Mr. Titmouse ate in
the house might choke him&mdash;a sally which received so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
very grave a rebuke from Mr. Aubrey, as brought the
hasty offender to her knees, begging forgiveness; which,
I need hardly say, she received, but with a very serious
admonition. Many of them most vehemently entreated
to be allowed to accompany Mr. Aubrey and his family
to London, and continue in their service, but in vain.
Mr. Aubrey had made his selection, having taken only
his own valet, and Mrs. Aubrey's maid, and one of the
nursery-maids, and declaring that on no consideration
would he think of being accompanied by any other of
the servants.</p>

<p>There were some twenty or thirty poor old infirm cottagers,
men and women, who had been for years weekly
pensioners on the bounty of Yatton, and respecting whom
Mr. Aubrey felt a painful anxiety. What could he do?
He gave the sum of fifty pounds to Dr. Tatham for their
use; and requested him to press their claims earnestly
upon the new proprietor of Yatton. He also wrote almost
as many letters, as there were of these poor people,
on their behalf to his friends and neighbors. Oh, it was
a moving scene which had occurred at each of their little
cottages, when their benefactors, Mr. Aubrey, his wife,
and sister, severally called to bid them farewell, and receive
their humble and tearful blessings! But it was
the parting with her school, which neither Kate nor her
brother saw any probability of being kept up longer than
for a month or two after their departure, which had occasioned
Kate the greatest distress. There were several
reasons, which will occur to the reader, why no application
could be made, about the matter, from her, or on her
account, to Mr. Titmouse; even if she had not had reason
to anticipate, from what she had heard of his character,
that he was a person unlikely to feel any interest in
such an institution. Nor had she liked to trouble or
burden the friends whom she left behind her, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
responsibility of supporting and superintending her little
establishment. She had nothing for it, therefore, but to
prepare the mistress, and her scholars, for the breaking
up of the school, within a month of her departure from
Yatton. She gave the worthy woman, the mistress, a
present of a five-pound note; and five shillings to each
of the children. She felt quite unequal to the task of
personally taking leave of them, as she had intended, and
several times attempted. She therefore, with many tears,
wrote the following lines, and gave them to Dr. Tatham,
to read aloud in the school, when their good and beautiful
writer should be far on her way towards London. The
little doctor paused a good many times while he read it,
and complained of his glasses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My dear little girls,&mdash;You know that I have already bid
each of you good-by; and though I tried to say something to
all of you at once, I was not able, because I was so sorry to
part with you, and tell you that my little school must be
given up. So I have written these few lines, to tell you that
I love you all, and have tried to be a good friend to you. Be
sure not to forget your spelling and reading, and your needle.
Your mothers have promised to hear you say your catechisms;
you must also be sure to say your prayers, and to read your
Bibles, and to behave very seriously at church, and to be always
dutiful to your parents. Then God will bless you all!
I hope you will not forget us, for we shall often think of you
when we are a great way off; and Dr. Tatham will now and
then write and tell us how you are going on. Farewell, my
dear little girls; and may God bless and preserve you all!
This is the prayer of both of us&mdash;Mrs. Aubrey and</p>

<div align="right"> "<span class="smcap">Catherine Aubrey.</span> </div>
<div align="left"> "<i>Yatton, 15th May 18&mdash;.</i>" </div>
</blockquote>

<p>The above was not written in the uniform and beautiful
hand usual with Miss Aubrey; it was, on the contrary,
rather irregular, and evidently written hastily; but Dr.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Tatham preserved it to the day of his death, and always
thought it beautiful.</p>

<p>On the ensuing morning, at a very early hour, Dr.
Tatham left the vicarage, to pay his last visit to friends
whom it almost broke his heart to part with, in all human
probability forever. He started, but on a moment's
reflection ceased to be surprised, at the sight of Mr. Aubrey
approaching him from the direction of the little
churchyard. He was calm, but his countenance bore the
traces of very recent emotion. They greeted each other
in silence, and so walked on for some time, arm-in-arm,
slowly, towards the Hall. It was a dull heavy morning,
almost threatening rain. The air seemed full of oppression.
The only sounds audible were the hoarse clamorous
sounds issuing from the old rookery, at some distance
on their left. Mr. Aubrey and Dr. Tatham interchanged
but few words, as they walked along the winding pathway
to the Hall. The first thing which attracted their
eyes, after passing under the gateway, was the large old
family carriage, standing opposite the Hall door, where
stood some luggage, sufficient for the journey, ready to
be placed upon it; the remainder having been sent on
the day before to London. How mournful was the sight!
On entering the Hall, they found its heart-broken inmates
all up, and dressed. The children were taking their last
breakfast in the nursery; Charles making many inquiries
of the weeping servants, which they could answer only by
tears and kisses. In vain was the breakfast-table spread
for the senior travellers. There sat poor Kate, in travelling
trim, before the antique silver urn, attempting to
perform, with tremulous hand, her accustomed office;
but neither she, nor Mrs. Aubrey, was equal to the task;
which, summoning the housekeeper into the room, they
devolved upon her, and which she was scarce able to perform.
Mr. Aubrey and Dr. Tatham were standing there;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
but neither of them spoke. A short time before, Mr.
Aubrey had requested the servants to be summoned, as
usual, to morning prayer in the accustomed room, and requested
Dr. Tatham to officiate. As soon, however, as
the sorrowful little assemblage was collected before him,
he whispered to Mr. Aubrey that he felt unequal to go
through the duty with the composure which it required;
and after a pause, he said, "Let us kneel down;" and in
a low voice, often interrupted by his own emotions, and
the sobs of those around him, he read, with touching simplicity
and solemnity, the ninety-first psalm; adding the
Lord's prayer, and a very tremulous benediction.</p>

<p>The bitter preparations for starting at an early hour,
seven o'clock, were soon afterwards completed. Half
smothered with the kisses and caresses of the affectionate
servants, little Charles and Agnes were already seated in
the carriage, on the laps of their two attendants, exclaiming
eagerly, "Come, papa! come, mamma! What a
while you are!" Just then, poor Pumpkin, the gardener,
scarce able to speak, made his appearance, his
arms full of nosegays, which he had been culling for the
last two hours&mdash;having one a-piece for each of the travellers,
servants, and children, and all. The loud angry
bark of Hector was heard from time to time, little
Charles calling loudly for him; but Pumpkin had fastened
him up, for fear of his starting off after the carriage.
At length, having scarcely tasted breakfast, the
travellers made their appearance at the Hall door. Kate
and Mrs. Aubrey were utterly overcome at the sight of
the carriage, and wept bitterly. They threw their arms
passionately around, and fervently kissed, their venerable
friend and pastor, Dr. Tatham, who was grievously agitated.
Then they tore themselves from him, and hastily
got into the carriage. As he stood alone, bareheaded, on
their quitting him, he lifted his hands, but could scarce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
utter a parting benediction. Mr. Aubrey, almost overpowered
with his emotions, then grasped his hand,
whispering, "Farewell, my dear and venerable friend!
Farewell!" "The Lord God of thy fathers bless thee!"
murmured Dr. Tatham, clasping Mr. Aubrey's hand in
both of his own, and looking solemnly upward. Mr.
Aubrey, taking off his hat, turned towards him an unutterable
look: then, waving his hand to the group of
agitated servants standing within and without the door,
he stepped into the carriage; the door was shut; and
they rolled slowly away. Outside the park gates were
collected more than a hundred people, to bid them farewell&mdash;all
the men, when the carriage came in sight, taking
off their hats. The carriage stopped for a moment.
"God bless you all! God bless you!" exclaimed Mr.
Aubrey, waving his hand, while from each window was
extended the white hand of Kate and Mrs. Aubrey, both
of which were fervently kissed and shaken by those who
were nearest. Again the carriage moved on; and quickening
their speed, the horses soon bore them out of the
village. Within less than half an hour afterwards, the
tearful eyes of the travellers, as they passed a familiar
turning of the road, had looked their last on Yatton!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note</span> <i>concerning the law of</i> <span class="smcap">Erasures</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Estoppels</span>.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Erasures.</span>&mdash;The question&mdash;What is the effect of an
erasure, an interlineation, or alteration apparent in a material
part of a deed above thirty years old, when offered in evidence?&mdash;has
led to much discussion both among professional and
general readers of this work, as well at home as abroad; and
many communications upon the subject have been received by
the author. Lord Widdrington at the trial, and subsequently
he and the full court, held, in the case of <i>Doe</i> d. <i>Titmouse</i> v.
<i>Jolter</i>, that such an erasure was fatal to the case of the party
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
who relied on the instrument in which it was exhibited. In
constructing this portion of the story, the author, aware of some
difference of opinion on the subject among lawyers, relied upon
the following passage in a work of great and long-established
authority, (<span class="smcap">Buller's</span> <i>Nisi Prius</i>, p. 255,) in which the law is
thus laid down&mdash;"If there be any [material] blemish, by razure
or interlineation, in a deed, it ought to be proved, though
it were above thirty years old, by the witnesses if living, and
if dead, by proving the handwriting of at least one of the witnesses,
and also the hand of the party, <i>in order to encounter the
presumption arising from the blemishes in the deed</i>." Such, also,
is the law laid down in Lord Chief Baron Gilbert's Treatise on
Evidence, (p. 89,) and the proposition appears adopted, and
these two high authorities cited, in the last edition, (the ninth,)
of that celebrated standard text-book, <span class="smcap">Phillips</span> <i>on Evidence</i>,
p. 205, published since the former edition of this work. There
is an impression, however, that this strict rule would not <i>now</i>
be acted upon; on the ground that the presumption resulting
from a continued possession, in conformity with the effect of a
deed with erasure or interlineation, is strong enough to overcome
the presumption of forgery afforded by the alterations
themselves. Still it is possible to foresee great danger arising
out of the adoption of such a rule: for a man enjoying an estate
in lands, less than one of fee simple, may alter the deed so
as to give to himself that superior estate, and then, after a lapse
of thirty years, produce the deed so altered, and thereby defeat
the innocent party challenging his title to the property. Possibly
it would now be submitted as a question for a jury to
decide, <i>whether the alteration had been made previously or subsequently
to the delivery of the deed?</i> for if <i>previously</i>, the deed
remains valid and binding. A deed thirty years old is called
"an ancient document," and is said to "prove itself"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> to
require no proof of its execution, provided it shall have been
produced from a custody which may be reasonably and naturally
explained, even though not the strictly proper legal custody.&mdash;See
the late case of Doe <i>d.</i> Neale <i>v.</i> Sampler, 8 <i>Adolphus
and Ellis' Rep.</i> 151; and Doe <i>d.</i> Wildgoose <i>v.</i> Pearce, 2
<i>Moody and Robinson</i>, 240. As to the point made by the Attorney-General,
at the trial, that where the right is once vested&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the instant after the execution of the deed&mdash;<i>such execution</i>
creating a title to the land in question&mdash;that right and
title cannot be affected by any subsequent alteration of the
deed;&mdash;it has been affirmed to be good law in a recent solemn
decision of the Court of Exchequer, and confirmed in a Court
of Error.&mdash;<i>See Davidson</i> v. <i>Cooper</i>, 11 Meeson <i>v.</i> Welsley,
799-800. "The moment after the execution of the deed, it
has become valueless," said Lord Abinger, "except as affording
<i>evidence</i> of the fact that it had been executed." In this case,
in which the author was engaged, (in 1843,) the whole doctrine
of erasures was thoroughly canvassed; and it was decided, on
error, that when an instrument, (whether under seal or not,)
which is <i>the foundation</i> of a right sought to be enforced, is altered
in a material part, even by a stranger, without the privity
of the party affected by it, such alteration makes the instrument
utterly void. The Scotch law respecting erasures is exceedingly
stringent; and even goes farther than that laid down by
Lord Widdrington.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Estoppel.</span>&mdash;Both this doctrine, and that of erasures, as
illustrated by this work, formed the subject of elaborate investigation
in an article in the <i>American Jurist</i> for 1842, (vol.
xxvii. pp. 50, et sec.) The question relating to estoppel, is
thus stated there in abstract terms. "If the son and heir-apparent
of a tenant in fee-simple, conveys the land thus held,
and afterwards dies in his father's lifetime, is the heir of the
father, who also makes his pedigree through the son, estopped
by that son's conveyance?" The conclusion arrived at is, that,
according to Lord Coke, if such conveyance had been with
warranty, the heir would be bound, if assets descended to him
from the son.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> But statute 4 and 5 Anne, c. 16 § 22, makes void
as against his heir all collateral warranties made by an ancestor
who has no estate of inheritance, in <i>possession</i>; and the Act
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
just passed, (1844&mdash;stat. 7 and 8 Vict. c. 76 § 5,) permitting
the alienation of contingent interests, expressly declares that it
shall not enable any heir to dispose of his <i>expectancy</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> By "Warranty," is meant the clause with which deeds of
feoffment formerly concluded, and by which the feoffor agreed that
he and his heirs would "warrant, acquit, and forever defend the
feoffee and his heirs against all persons." This old form has long
been obsolete; and may be considered to have been, by two late
statutes, abolished.</p></div>

<p>In this story an heir is represented as conveying away his
expectancy; and the author has received an obliging communication
on the subject, from one of the greatest conveyancers
who ever lived&mdash;Mr. Preston&mdash;to the following effect. "The
rule of law is&mdash;<i>Qui non habet, ille non dat: nemo potest plus
juris in alium transferre, quam ipse habet.</i> Therefore a grant by
an expectant heir, <i>simpliciter</i>, is void. But the doctrine of
<i>estoppels</i> (a 'cunning learning,' says Lord Coke) affords exceptions
to this general rule." A feoffment with warranty binds
an heir, however, not by estoppel, but by <i>rebutter</i>, "in order to
avoid circuity of action, which is not favored by the law."&mdash;(Co.
Litt. 265 a.) He might be estopped by a lease for years,
and by matter of record&mdash;or by fine and recovery, before those
methods of assurance were abolished; but a conveyance by
Lease and Release would not bind the heir, on the subsequent
descent of the estate: for he had <i>no right at all</i> at the time of
the release, made, but that once in the ancestor; after whose
decease the heir may enter in to the land against his own release.&mdash;(Co.
Litt. 265 a.) "The late vice-chancellor, Sir John
Leach," says Mr. Preston, "once decided that a release <i>did</i>
operate as an estoppel, in conformity with my argument before
him; but Lord Lyndhurst on appeal, contrary to his own first
impression, on Sir Edward Sugden's handing up to him my
own Book on Conveyancing, as a <i>contre projet</i> to my attempt to
support the vice-chancellor's decision, overruled that decision."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>Rank is very apt to attract and dazzle vulgar and feeble
optics; and the belief that such is its effect upon mankind
generally, is unspeakably gratifying to a vain and ignorant
possessor of that rank. Of the truth of one part of this
observation, take as an illustration the case of Tittlebat
Titmouse; of the other, that of the Earl of Dreddlington.
The former's dinner engagement with the latter, his august
and awful kinsman, was an event of such magnitude
as to absorb almost all his faculties in the contemplation
of it, and also occasion him great anxiety in preparing for
an effective appearance upon so signal an occasion. Mr.
Gammon had repeatedly, during the interval, instructed
his anxious pupil, if so he might be called, as to the manner
in which he ought to behave. He was&mdash;Heaven
save the mark, poor Titmouse!&mdash;to assume an air of
mingled deference, self-possession, and firmness; not, on
the one hand, to be overawed by the greatness with which
he would be brought into contact, nor, on the other, unduly
elated by a sense of his own suddenly acquired
importance. He was, on the contrary, to steer evenly
between the extremes of timorousness and temerity&mdash;to
<i>aim</i>, at least, at that happy mean, so grateful to those
able to appreciate the effort, and object, of those who had
attained to it. Titmouse was to remember that, great as
was the Earl of Dreddlington, he was yet <i>but a man</i>&mdash;related,
too, by consanguinity, to him, the aforesaid Titmouse;
who might, moreover, before many years should
have elapsed, become himself Lord Drelincourt, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
consequence equally entitled, with the present possessor
of that resplendent rank, to the homage of mankind. At
the same time that the earl's advanced years gave him a
natural claim to the reverence of his young kinsman&mdash;(whom
his Lordship was about to introduce into the sublime
regions of aristocracy, and also of political society)&mdash;Titmouse
might extract a few ingredients of consolation
from the reflection, that his income probably <i>exceeded</i>,
by a third, that of the Earl of Dreddlington. This is the
sum of Mr. Gammon's <i>general</i> instructions to his eager
and excited pupil; but he also gave Titmouse many minor
hints and suggestions. He was to drink very little wine&mdash;(whereat
Titmouse demurred somewhat vehemently,
and asked "How the d&mdash;l he was to <i>get his steam</i> up without
it?")&mdash;and on no account to call for beer or porter,
to which plebeian beverages, indeed, he might consider
himself as having bid a long and last adieu;&mdash;to say
occasionally, only, "my Lord" and "your Lordship," in
addressing the earl&mdash;and "your Ladyship," in addressing
Lady Cecilia;&mdash;and, above all, never to appear in a hurry,
but to do and say whatever he had to do and say calmly;
for that the nerves of aristocracy were very delicate, and
could not bear a bustle, or the slightest display of energy
or feeling. Then, as to his <i>dress</i>&mdash;Gammon, feeling himself
treading on very doubtful ground, intimated merely
that the essence of true fashion was <i>simplicity</i>&mdash;but here
Titmouse grew fidgety, and his Mentor ceased.</p>

<p>During the night which ushered in the eventful day on
which Titmouse dined with the Earl of Dreddlington, our
friend got but very little sleep. Early in the morning
he engaged a most respectable glass-coach to convey him
westward in the evening, in something like style; and
before noon, his anxieties were set at rest by the punctual
arrival of various articles of dress, decoration, and scent&mdash;for
Titmouse had a great idea of scents. As for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
new watch and its brilliant gold guard-chain&mdash;ambitious
reader! you should have seen them! About half-past
four o'clock Titmouse retired to his bedroom, and resigned
himself into the hands of Mr. Twirl, the tip-top hairdresser
from the Strand, whose agreeable manipulations, and
still more agreeable small-talk, occupied upwards of an
hour; Titmouse, from time to time, giving the anxious
operator abundant notice of the high quarter in which his
handiwork was likely soon to be scrutinized.</p>

<p>"Pray-a, can you tell me," quoth Titmouse, drawlingly,
shortly after Twirl had commenced his operations, "how
long it will take me to get from this infernal part of the
town to Grosvenor Square? <i>Dem</i> long way, isn't it, Mr.
What's-your-name?"</p>

<p>"Grosvenor Square, sir?" said Twirl, glibly, but with
a perceptible dash of deference in his tone; "why it <i>is</i>
as one might say a tolerable way off, certainly; but you
can't well miss your way <i>there</i>, sir, of all places in
town"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My coachman," interrupted Titmouse, with a fine air,
"of course, had I thought of it, <i>he</i> must know, dem him,
of course!"</p>

<p>"Oh! to be sure, sir. There's none but people of the
most <i>highest</i> rank lives in that quarter, sir. Excuse me,
sir, but I've a brother-in-law that's valet to the Duke of
Dunderwhistle there"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed! How far off is that from Lord Dreddlington's?"
inquired Titmouse, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Lord Dreddlington's, sir?&mdash;Well, I never! Isn't it
particular strange, if that's where you're going, sir&mdash;it's
next door to the Duke's&mdash;the very next door,
sir!"</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, is it indeed? How devilish odd!"</p>

<p>"Know the Earl of Dreddlington then, I presume,
sir?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ya-as, I should think so; he's my&mdash;my&mdash;relation,
that's all; and devilish near too!"</p>

<p>Mr. Twirl instantly conceived a kind of reverence for
the gentleman upon whom he was operating.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he presently added in a still more respectful
tone than before, "p'r'aps you'll think it a liberty,
sir; but, do you know, I've several times had the honor
of seeing his Lordship in the street at a little distance&mdash;and
there's a&mdash;a family likeness between you, sir&mdash;'pon
my word, sir. It struck me, directly I saw you, that you
was like some <i>nob</i> I'd seen at the other end of the town."
[Here Titmouse experienced pleasurable sensations, similar
to those said to be enjoyed by a cat when you pass
your hand down its glossy coat in the right direction.]
"Will you allow me, sir, to give your hair a good brushing,
sir, before I dress it? I always like to take the <i>greatest</i>
pains with the hair of my quality customers!&mdash;Do you
know, sir, that I had the honor of dressing his Grace's
hair for a whole fortnight together, once when my brother-in-law
was ill; and though p'r'aps I oughtn't to say it,
his Grace expressed the highest satisfaction at my exertions,
sir."</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, and <i>I</i> should say you were an uncommon
good hand&mdash;I've known lots worse, I assure you;
men that would have spoiled the best head of hair going,
by Jove!"</p>

<p>"Sir, you're very kind. I assure you, sir, that to do
justice to a <i>gent's</i> hair requires an uncommon deal of practice,
and a sort of <i>nat'ral</i> talent for it besides. Lord, sir!
how much depends on a gent's hair, don't it? Of two
coming into a room, it makes all the difference, sir! Believe
me, sir, it's no use being well-dressed, nay, nor good-looking,
if as how the hair a'n't done&mdash;what I call&mdash;<i>correct!</i>"</p>

<p>"By Jove, I really think you're nigh about the mark,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
said Titmouse; and after a pause, during which Mr. Twirl
had been brushing away at one particular part of the head
with some vehemence, "Well," he exclaimed with a sigh,
ceasing for a moment his vigorous exertions&mdash;"I'm <i>blest</i>
if I can manage it, do what I will!"</p>

<p>"Eh? What's that? What is it?" inquired Titmouse,
a little alarmedly.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, it's what we gents, in our profession, calls a
<i>feather</i>, which is the most <i>hobstinatest</i> thing in nature."</p>

<p>"What's a <i>feather</i>?" quoth Titmouse, rather faintly.</p>

<p>"You see, sir, 'tis when a small lot of hair on a gent's
head <i>will</i> stick up, do all we can to try and get it down;
and (excuse me, sir,) <i>you've</i> got a regular rattler!" Titmouse
put up his hand to feel, Twirl guiding it to the fatal
spot; there it was, just as Twirl had described it.</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" murmured Titmouse.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, sir, you don't use our <small>OSTRICH GREASE</small> and
<small>RHINOCEROS MARROW</small>, sir."</p>

<p>"Your <i>what</i>?" cried Titmouse, apprehensively, with a
dismally distinct recollection of the tragedy of the Cyanochaitanthropopoion,
and the Damascus Cream, and the
Tetaragmenon Abracadabra; matters which he at once
mentioned to Mr. Twirl.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's not <i>my</i> custom, sir," quoth Twirl, "to run
down other gents' inventions; but my real opinion is,
that they're all an imposition&mdash;a rank imposition, sir.
I didn't like to say it, sir; but I soon saw there had been
somebody a-prac<i>ti</i>sing on your hair."</p>

<p>"What, is it <i>very</i> plain?" cried Titmouse, with a kind
of horror, starting up and stepping to the glass.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;not so <i>very</i> plain; only <i>you've</i> got, as I
might say, <i>accustomed</i> to the sight of it; but when it's
properly curled, and puckered up, and frizzed about, it
won't show&mdash;nor the feather neither, sir; so, by your
leave, here goes, sir;" and, after about a quarter of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
hour's more labor, he succeeded in parting it right down
the middle of the head, bringing it out into a bold curl
towards each eyebrow, and giving our friend quite a new
and very fascinating appearance, even in his own eyes.
And as for the color&mdash;it really was not so very marked,
after all; a little purple-hued and mottled, to be sure, in
parts, but not to a degree to attract the eye of a casual
observer. Twirl having declared, at length, his labors
completed&mdash;regarding Titmouse's head with a look of
proud satisfaction&mdash;Titmouse paid him half a crown, and
also ordered a pot of ostrich grease and of rhinoceros marrow,
(the one being <i>suet</i>, the other <i>lard</i>, differently scented
and colored,) and was soon left at liberty to proceed with
the important duties of the toilet. It took him a good
while; but in the end he was supremely successful. He
wore black tights, (<i>i. e.</i> pantaloons fitting closely to his
legs, and tied round his ankles with black ribbons,) silk
stockings, and shoes with glittering silver buckles. His
white neckerchief was tied with great elegance, not a superfluous
wrinkle being visible in it. His shirt-front of
lace, had two handsome diamond pins, connected together
by a little delicate gold chain, glistening in the midst of
it. Then he had a white waistcoat edge, next a crimson
one, and lastly a glorious sky-blue satin waistcoat, spangled
all over with gold flowers inwrought&mdash;and across it
hung his new gold watch-guard, and his silver guard for
his eyeglass, producing an inconceivably fine effect. His
coat was of a light brown, of exquisite cut, fitting him as
closely as if he had been born in it, and with burnished
brass buttons, of sugar-loaf shape. 'Twas padded also
with great judgment, and really took off more of his
round-shouldered awkwardness of figure than any coat he
had ever worn before. Then he had a fine white pocket-handkerchief,
soaked in lavender water; and immaculate
white kid gloves. Thus habited, he stood before his glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
bowing fifty different times, and adjusting his expression
to various elegant forms of address. He was particularly
struck with the combined effect of the two curls of his
hair towards each eye, and the hair underneath his chin
curved upwards on each side of his mouth in complete
symmetry. I have ascertained from Mr. Titmouse himself,
that on this memorable occasion of his first introduction
to <small>NOBILITY</small>, every item of dress and decoration was
entirely new; and when at length his labors had been
completed, he felt great composure of mind, and a consciousness
of the decisive effect which he must needs produce
upon those into whose presence he was so soon to be
ushered. His "carriage" was presently announced; and
after keeping it standing for a few minutes, (which he
conceived to be usual with fine people,) he gently placed
his hat upon his head; drew on one glove, took his little
ebony cane in his hand; and, with a hurried inward
prayer that he might be equal to the occasion, stepped
forth from his apartment and passed on to the glass-coach.
Such a brilliant little figure, I will take upon myself to
say, had never before issued, nor will perhaps ever again
issue, from the Cabbage-Stalk Hotel. The waiters whom
he passed, inclined towards him with instinctive reverence.
He was <i>very</i> fine, to be sure; but who could, they justly
thought, be dressed too finely that had ten thousand a-year,
and was gone to dine with a lord in Grosvenor
Square?</p>

<p>Titmouse was soon on his way towards that at once
desired and dreaded region. He gazed with a look of
occasional pity and contempt, as he passed along, at the
plebeian pedestrians, and the lines of shops on each side
of the narrow streets, till increasing indications of superior
modes of existence presented themselves; and then
he began to feel not a little fidgety and nervous. The
streets grew wider; the squares greater; hackney-coaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
(unsightly objects!) became fewer and fewer, giving place
to splendid vehicles&mdash;coaches, and chariots&mdash;with one,
two, and even three footmen, in elegant liveries, clustering
behind, with long canes, cockades, and shoulder-knots;
crimson, blue, green, bear and tiger skin hammercloths,
with burnished coronets and crests upon them; sleek
coachmen with wigs and three-cornered hats, and horses
that pawed the ground with very pride; ladies within, glistening
in satin, lace, and jewels&mdash;their lords beside them,
leaning back with countenances so stern and haughty;
oh, by all that was grand and tremendous! Titmouse
felt himself getting now within the very vortex of greatness
and fashion, and experienced a frequent fluttering
and catching of the breath, and a sense of indefinite distressing
apprehension. He was, however, now <i>in for it</i>&mdash;and
there was no retreat. As he neared Grosvenor
Square, he heard, ever and anon, terrific thundering
noises at the doors opposite which these splendid vehicles
had drawn up&mdash;as if the impatient footmen were
infuriated because the doors did not fly open of themselves,
at the sound of the approaching carriage-wheels.
At length he entered Grosvenor Square, that "pure empyrean"
of earthly greatness. Carriages rolled calmly
and haughtily past him, others dashed desperately in different
directions. At each side of Lord Dreddlington's
house, were carriages setting down with tremendous uproar.
Mr. Titmouse felt his color going, and his heart
began to beat much faster than usual. 'Twas quite in
vain that he "hemmed" two or three times, by way of
trying to reassure himself: he felt that his hour was
come; and would have been glad, at the moment, of any
decent excuse for driving off home again, and putting off
the evil day a little longer. Opposite the dreaded door
had now drawn up Mr. Titmouse's glass-coach; and the
decent coachman&mdash;whose well-worn hat, and long, clean,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
but threadbare blue coat, and ancient-looking top-boots,
bespoke their wearer's thriftiness&mdash;slowly alighting, threw
the reins on his quiet horses' backs, and gave a modest <i>rat-tat-tat-tat-tat</i>
at the door without ringing.</p>

<p>"What name shall I give, sir?" said he, returning to
his coach, and letting down the loud clanking steps, with
such a noise as seemed to indicate his desire to show the
solid metal structure of them!</p>

<p>"Titmouse&mdash;Mr. Titmouse;" replied our friend,
hurriedly, as the lofty door was thrown open by the
corpulent porter; disclosing several footmen in light
blue liveries, with silver shoulder-knots, and powdered
heads, standing in the hall waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Titmouse!" exclaimed the coachman to the servants:
then, having returned to the coach&mdash;"When shall
I come back for you, sir?" he inquired of his flustered
fare.</p>

<p>"D&mdash; me, sir&mdash;don't bother <i>me</i>," faltered Titmouse,
quitting the vehicle with great trepidation: and the next
moment he was in the hands of the Philistines&mdash;the hall
door was closed upon him. All his presence of mind had
evaporated; the excellent lessons given him by Mr. Gammon
had disappeared like breath from the surface of a
mirror. Though Lord Dreddlington's servants had never
before seen in the house so strange an object as poor little
Titmouse, they were of far too highly polished manners
to appear to notice anything unusual. They silently motioned
him up-stairs with a bland courteous air, he carrying
his little agate-headed cane in one hand, and his new
hat in the other. A gentlemanly person in a full black
dress suit, opened the drawing-room door for him, with
an elegant inclination, which Titmouse very gracefully returned.
A faint mist seemed to be in the drawing-room
for a second or two, during which Titmouse heard his
name gently whispered by the gentleman who had introduced
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
him; quickly clearing away, however, he beheld,
at the upper end, but two figures, that of an old
gentleman, and a young lady&mdash;they were, in fact, the
Earl of Dreddlington and Lady Cecilia. Now&mdash;if truth
must be told&mdash;that great man had not been a whit behindhand,
in the matter of dress, with the little creature
now trembling before him; being, in truth, full as anxious
to make an effective first appearance in the eyes of
Mr. Titmouse, as he in those of the Earl of Dreddlington.
And each had, in his way, completely succeeded. There
was little or no substantial difference between them. The
Right Honorable the Earl of Dreddlington was an old experienced
fool, and Tittlebat Titmouse a young inexperienced
one. They were the same species of plant, but had
grown in different soils. The one had had to struggle
through a neglected existence by the dusty, hard road-side
of life; the other had had all the advantage of hothouse
cultivation&mdash;its roots striking deep into, and
thriving upon, the rich manure of sycophancy and adulation!&mdash;We
have seen how anxious was our little friend
to appear as became the occasion, before his great kinsman;
who in his turn had several times during the day exulted
secretly in the anticipation of the impression which
must be produced upon the mind of Titmouse by the sudden
display, in the earl's person, of the sublimest distinctions
which society can bestow, short of royalty. It had
once or twice occurred to the earl, whether he could find
any fair excuse for appearing in his full general's uniform;
but on maturer reflection, governed by that simplicity and
severity of taste which ever distinguished him, he had
abandoned that idea, and appeared in a plain blue coat,
white waistcoat, and black knee-breeches. But on his
left breast glittered one or two foreign orders, and across
his waistcoat was the broad red ribbon of the Bath. His
hair was white and fine; his cold blue eye and haughty
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
lip gave him an expression of severe dignity: and he
stood erect as an arrow. Lady Cecilia reclined on the
sofa, with an air of languor and <i>ennui</i> which had become
habitual to her; and was dressed in glistening white
satin, with a necklace of large and very beautiful pearls.
The earl was standing in an attitude of easy grace to receive
his guest, as to whose personal appearance, by the
way, he was quite in the dark&mdash;Mr. Titmouse might be
a great or a little man, and forward or bashful; and require
a corresponding demeanor and address on the part
of the earl. "Gracious Powers!" he involuntarily exclaimed
to himself, the instant his eye caught sight of
Titmouse, who approached slowly, making profound and
formal obeisances. The earl stood rooted to the spot
which he had occupied when Titmouse entered. If his
servants had turned an ape into the drawing-room, his
Lordship could scarcely have felt or exhibited greater
amazement than he now experienced, for a moment.
"Ah, Heavens!" thought he, "what a fool have we here?
what creature is this?" Then it flashed across his mind;&mdash;"May
this be <span class="smcap">the future Lord Drelincourt</span>?" He
was on the point of recoiling from his suddenly-discovered
kinsman in dismay, (as for Lady Cecilia, she gazed at him,
through her glass, in silent horror, after a faint exclamation,
on his first becoming visible, of "Gracious! Papa!")
when his habitual self-command came to his assistance;
and, advancing very slowly a step or two towards Titmouse&mdash;who,
after a hurried glance around him, saw
no place to deposit his hat and cane upon except the
floor, on which he accordingly dropped them&mdash;the earl
extended his hand, slightly compressed the tips of Titmouse's
fingers, and bowed courteously, but with infinite
concern in his features.</p>

<p>"I am happy, Mr. Titmouse, to make your acquaintance,"
said the earl, slowly&mdash;"Sir, I have the honor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
present you to my daughter, the Lady Cecilia." Titmouse,
who by this time had got into a sort of cold
sweat&mdash;a condition from which the earl was really not
<i>very</i> far removed&mdash;made a very profound and formal
bow, (he had been taking lessons from a posture-master
to one of the theatres,) first to the earl, and then to
Lady Cecilia, who rose about two inches from the sofa,
with an almost audible sigh, and then sank again upon it,
without removing her eyes from the figure of Titmouse,
who went on bowing, first to the one and then to the
other, till the earl had engaged him in conversation.</p>

<p>"It gives me pleasure, sir, to see that you are punctual
in your engagements. I am so too, sir; and owe to it no
small portion of any success which I may have had in life.
Punctuality, sir, in small matters, leads to punctuality in
great matters." This was said very deliberately, and with
a sort of freezing grandeur.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, my Lord! quite so, your Lordship," stammered
Titmouse, suddenly recollecting a part of Gammon's
instructions; "to be sure&mdash;wouldn't have been
behind time, your Lordship, for a minute, my Lord; uncommon
bad manners, if it please your Lordship"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you be seated, sir?" interrupted the earl, dignifiedly
motioning him to a chair, and then sitting down
beside him; after which his Lordship seemed, for a second
or two, to forget himself; staring in silence at Titmouse,
and then in consternation at Lady Cecilia. "I&mdash;I&mdash;"
said he, suddenly recollecting himself, "beg your par&mdash;sir,
I mean&mdash;I congratulate you upon&mdash;your recent
success. Sir, it must have been rather a surprise to
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir&mdash;my Lord, most uncommon, may it please
your Lordship&mdash;particular&mdash;but <i>right is right</i>&mdash;please
your Lordship"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>["Oh Heavens! merciful Heavens! How horrid is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
this! Am I awake or only dreaming? 'Tis an idiot&mdash;and
what's worse, a vulgar idiot! <i>And this thing may
become Lord Drelincourt!</i>" This was what was passing
through Lord Dreddlington's mind, while his troubled eye
was fixed upon Titmouse.]</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, Mr. Titmouse," replied his Lordship,
"very true, sir; what you say is correct. Quite so; exactly."
His eye was fixed on Titmouse, but his words
were uttered, as it were, mechanically, and in a musing
manner. It flitted for a moment across his mind, whether
he should ring the bell, and order the servant to show out
of the house the fearful imp which had just been shown
into it; but at that critical moment he detected poor Titmouse's
eye fixed with a kind of reverent intensity upon
his Lordship's glittering orders. 'Twas a lucky look, that,
for Titmouse, since it began to melt away the ice which
was beginning to incrust the little heart of his august
relative. 'Twas evident that the poor young man had
not been accustomed to society, thought the earl, with
an approach towards the compassionate mood. He was
frightfully dressed, to be sure; and as for his speech, he
was manifestly overawed by the Presence in which he
found himself; [that thought melted a little more of the
ice.] Yet, was it not evident that he had <i>some</i> latent
power of appreciating real distinction, when he beheld
it? [his Lordship's little heart here lost <i>all</i> the ice which
had begun so suddenly to collect round it.] And again;&mdash;he
has actually thrust out the intolerable Aubrey,
and is now lawful owner of Yatton&mdash;of <small>TEN THOUSAND
A-YEAR</small>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you see the review, to-day, sir?" inquired the
earl, rather blandly&mdash;"His Majesty was there, sir, and
seemed to enjoy the scene." Titmouse, with a timid air,
said that he had not seen it, as he had been at a boatrace
upon the river; and after a few more general observations&mdash;"Will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
you permit me, sir? It is from <small>A QUARTER</small>
requiring the highest&mdash;a-hem!" said the earl, as a
note was brought him, which he immediately opened and
read. Lady Cecilia, also, appearing to be reading, Titmouse
had a moment's breathing time and interval of
relief. What would he have given, he thought, for some
other person, or several persons, to come in and divide
the attention&mdash;the intolerably oppressive attention of the
two august individuals then before him! He seized the
opportunity to cast a furtive glance around the room. It
opened into a second, which opened into a third: how
spacious, each, and lofty! And glittering glass chandeliers
in each! What chimney and pier glasses! What rich
flowered satin curtains&mdash;they must have cost twelve or
fourteen shillings a-yard at least!&mdash;The carpets, of the
finest Brussels&mdash;and they felt like velvet to the feet;&mdash;then
the brackets, of marble and gold, with snowy statues
and vases glistening upon each; chairs so delicate, and
gilded all over&mdash;he almost feared to sit down on them.
What would the Quirks and Tag-rags think of this!
Faugh&mdash;only to think for a moment of Alibi House and
Satin Lodge!&mdash;Then there was the Lady Cecilia&mdash;a lady
of high rank! How rich her dress&mdash;and how haughtily
beautiful she looked as she reclined upon the sofa! [she
was in fact busy conning over the new opera, which was
to come out the next evening.] And the Earl of Dreddlington&mdash;there
he was, reading, doubtless, some letter
from the king or one of the royal family&mdash;a man of great
rank&mdash;resplendent in his decorations&mdash;all just according
to what he had seen in pictures, and heard and read of&mdash;what
must that red ribbon have cost? Ay, indeed, poor
Lord Dreddlington, it had cost you the labor of half a life
of steadfast sycophancy, of watchful man&#339;uvring, and
desperate exertion! And at last, the minister tossed it to
you in a moment of disgust and despair&mdash;mortally perplexed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
by the conflicting claims of two sulky dukes and
a querulous old marquis, each of whom threatened to withdraw
his "<i>influence and support</i>," if his <i>rival's</i> claims were
preferred! He had never seen any of such a breadth.&mdash;It
must have been manufactured on purpose for the earl!
How white were his hands! And he had an antique massive
signet-ring on his forefinger, and two glittering rings
at least on each of his little fingers&mdash;positively Titmouse
at length began to regard him almost as a god:&mdash;and
yet the amazing thought occurred that this august being
was allied to him by the ties of relationship! Such were
the thoughts and reflections passing through the mind of
Titmouse, during the time that Lord Dreddlington was
engaged in reading his letter&mdash;and afterwards during the
brief intervals which elapsed between the various observations
addressed to him by his Lordship.</p>

<p>The gentleman in black at length entered the room,
and advancing slowly and noiselessly towards the earl,
said in a gentlemanlike manner, "Dinner, my Lord;"
and retired. Into what new scenes of splendid embarrassment
was this the signal for Mr. Titmouse's introduction?
thought our friend, and trembled.</p>

<p>"Mr. Titmouse, will you give your arm to the Lady
Cecilia?" said the earl, motioning him to the sofa. Up
jumped Titmouse, and approached hastily the recumbent
beauty; who languidly arose, arranged her train with one
hand, and with the other, having drawn on her glove,
just barely touched the proffered arm of Titmouse, extended
towards her at a very acute angle, and at right
angles with his own body&mdash;stammering, "Honor to take
your Ladyship&mdash;uncommon proud&mdash;this way, my Lady."
Lady Cecilia took no more notice of him than if he had
been a dumb waiter; walking beside him in silence&mdash;the
earl following. To think that a nobleman of high rank
was walking <i>behind</i> him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Would to heaven, thought the embarrassed Titmouse,
that he had two fronts, one for the earl behind, and the
other to be turned full towards Lady Cecilia! The tall
servants, powdered and in light blue liveries, stood like a
guard of honor around the dining-room door. That room
was extensive and lofty: what a solitary sort of state were
they about to dine in! Titmouse felt cold, though it was
summer; and trembled as he followed, rather than led,
his haughty partner to her seat; and then was motioned
into his own by the earl, himself sitting down opposite an
antique silver soup tureen! A servant stood behind Lady
Cecilia; another behind Titmouse; and a third on the
left of the earl; while on his right, between his Lordship
and the glistening sideboard, stood a portly gentleman
in black, with a bald head and&mdash;Titmouse thought&mdash;a
somewhat haughty countenance. Though Titmouse had
touched nothing since breakfast, he felt not the slightest
inclination to eat, and would have given the world to have
dared to say as much, and be at once relieved from a vast
deal of anxiety. Is it indeed easy to conceive of a fellow-creature
in a state of more complete thraldom, at that
moment, than poor little Titmouse? A little animal under
the suddenly exhausted receiver of an air-pump, or a fish
just plucked out of its own element, and flung gasping
and struggling upon the grass, may serve to assist your
conceptions of the position and sufferings of Mr. Titmouse.
The earl, who was on the look-out for it, observed his condition
with secret but complete satisfaction; here he beheld
the legitimate effect of rank and state upon the
human mind. Titmouse got through the soup&mdash;of which
about half a dozen spoonfuls only were put into his plate&mdash;pretty
fairly. Anywhere else than at Lord Dreddlington's,
Titmouse would have thought it poor, thin, watery
stuff, with a few green things chopped up and swimming
in it; but now he perceived that it had a sort of superior
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
flavor. How some red mullet, enclosed in paper,
puzzled poor Titmouse, is best known to himself.</p>

<p>"The Lady Cecilia will take wine with you, Mr. Titmouse,
I dare say, by-and-by," observed the earl, blandly;
and in a moment's time, but with perfect deliberation, the
servants poured wine into the two glasses. "Your Ladyship's
health, my Lady"&mdash;faltered Titmouse. She slightly
bowed, and a faint smile glimmered at the corners of her
mouth&mdash;but unobserved by Titmouse.</p>

<p>"I think you said, Mr. Titmouse," quoth the earl,
some time afterwards, "that you had not yet taken
possession of Yatton?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord; but I go down the day after to-morrow&mdash;quite&mdash;if
I may say it, my Lord&mdash;quite in style"&mdash;answered
Titmouse, with humble and hesitating jocularity
of manner.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!"&mdash;exclaimed the earl, gently.</p>

<p>"Had you any acquaintance with the Aubreys, Mr.
Titmouse?" inquired the Lady Cecilia.</p>

<p>"No, my Lady&mdash;yes, your Ladyship, (I beg your Ladyship's
pardon)&mdash;but, now I think of it, I had a slight
acquaintance with Miss Aubrey." [Titmouse, Titmouse,
you little wretch, how dare you say so?]</p>

<p>"She is considered pretty in the country, I believe,"
drawled Lady Cecilia, languidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, most uncommon lovely!&mdash;<i>middling</i>, only middling,
my Lady, I should say"&mdash;added Titmouse, suddenly;
having observed, as he fancied, rather a displeased
look in Lady Cecilia. He had begun his sentence with
more energy than he had yet shown in the house; he finished
it hastily, and colored as he spoke&mdash;feeling that
he had, somehow or another, committed himself.</p>

<p>"Do you form a new establishment at Yatton, sir?"
inquired the earl, "or take to any part of that of your
predecessor?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have not, please your Lordship, made up my
mind yet exactly&mdash;should like to know your Lordship's
opinion."</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I should be governed by circumstances&mdash;by
circumstances, sir; when you get there, sir, you will
be better able to judge of the course you should pursue."
Titmouse made an humble obeisance.</p>

<p>"Do you intend, Mr. Titmouse, to live in town, or in
the country?" inquired Lady Cecilia.</p>

<p>"A little of both, my Lady&mdash;but mostly in town; because,
as your Ladyship sees, the country is <i>devilish</i> dull&mdash;'pon
my life, my Lady&mdash;my Lord&mdash;beg a thousand
pardons," he suddenly added, bowing to both, and blushing
violently. Here he <i>had</i> committed himself, and awfully;
but his august companions bowed to him very kindly, and
he presently recovered his self-possession.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of hunting, Mr. Titmouse?" inquired
the earl.</p>

<p>"Why, my Lord, can't exactly say that I am&mdash;but
your Lordship sees, cases alter circumstances, and when
I get down there among the country gents, p'r'aps I may
do as they do, my Lord."</p>

<p>"I presume, Mr. Titmouse, you have scarcely chosen a
town residence yet?" inquired Lady Cecilia.</p>

<p>"No, my Lady&mdash;not fixed it yet&mdash;was thinking of
taking Mr. Aubrey's house in Grosvenor Street, understanding
it is to be sold;" then turning towards the earl&mdash;"because,
as your Lordship sees, I was thinking of getting
into <i>both</i> the nests of the old birds, while both are
warm"&mdash;he added with a very faint smile.</p>

<p>"Exactly; yes&mdash;I see, sir&mdash;I understand you," replied
Lord Dreddlington, sipping his wine. His manner
rather discomposed Titmouse, to whom it then very naturally
occurred that the earl might be warmly attached
to the Aubreys, and not relish their being spoken of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
lightly; so Titmouse hastily and anxiously added&mdash;"Your
Lordship sees I was most <i>particular</i> sorry to make the
Aubreys turn out. A most uncommon respectable gent,
Mr. Aubrey: I assure your Lordship I think so."</p>

<p>"I had not the honor of his acquaintance, sir," replied
the earl, coldly, and with exceeding stiffness, which
flustered Titmouse not a little; and a pause occurred in
the conversation for nearly a minute. Dinner had now
considerably advanced, and Titmouse was beginning to
grow a <i>little</i> familiar with the routine of matters. Remembering
Gammon's caution concerning the wine, and
also observing how very little was drunk by the earl and
Lady Cecilia, Titmouse did the same; and during the
whole of dinner had scarcely four full glasses of wine.</p>

<p>"How long is it," inquired the earl, addressing his
daughter, "since the Aubreys took that house?" Lady
Cecilia could not say. "Stay&mdash;now I recollect&mdash;surely
it was just before my appointment to the Household. Yes;
it was about that time, I now recollect. I am alluding,
Mr. Titmouse," continued the earl, addressing him in
a very gracious manner, "to an appointment under the
Crown of some little distinction, which I was solicited to
accept at the personal instance of his Majesty, on the occasion
of our party coming into power&mdash;I mean that of
Lord Steward of the Household."</p>

<p>"Dear me, my Lord! Indeed! Only to think, your
Lordship!" exclaimed Titmouse, with such a profound deference
in his manner as encouraged the earl to proceed.</p>

<p>"That, sir, was an office of great importance, and I had
some hesitation in undertaking its responsibility. But,
sir, when I had once committed myself to my sovereign
and my country, I resolved to give them my best services.
I had formed plans for effecting very extensive alterations,
sir, in that department of the public service, which I have
no doubt would have given great satisfaction to the country,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
as soon as the nature of my intentions became generally
understood; when faction, sir, unfortunately prevailed,
and we were compelled to relinquish office."</p>

<p>"Dear me, my Lord! How particular sorry I am to
hear it, my Lord!" exclaimed Titmouse, as he gazed at
the baffled statesman with an expression of respectful
sympathy.</p>

<p>"Sir, it gives me sincere satisfaction," said the earl, after
a pause, "to hear that our political opinions agree"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh yes! my Lord, quite; <i>sure</i> of that"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I assure you, sir, that some little acquaintance with
the genius and spirit of the British constitution has satisfied
me that this country can never be safely or advantageously
governed except on sound Whig principles."&mdash;He
paused.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord; it's quite true, your Lordship"&mdash;interposed
Titmouse, reverentially.</p>

<p>"That, sir, is the only way I know of, by which aristocratic
institutions can be brought to bear effectively upon,
to blend harmoniously with the interests of the lower orders&mdash;<i>the
people</i>, Mr. Titmouse." Titmouse thought this
wonderfully fine, and sat listening as to an oracle of political
wisdom. The earl, observing it, began to form a much
higher opinion of his little kinsman. "The unfortunate
gentleman, your predecessor at Yatton, sir, if he had but
allowed himself to have been guided by those who had
mixed in public affairs before he was born," said the earl,
with great dignity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Pon my word, my Lord, he was, I've heard, a d&mdash;d
Tory!&mdash;Oh my Lady! my Lord! humbly beg pardon,"
he added, turning pale; but the fatal word had been uttered,
and heard by both; and he felt as if he could have
sunk through the floor.</p>

<p>"Shall I have the honor of taking another glass of wine
with you, sir?" inquired the earl, rather gravely and severely,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
as if wishing Mr. Titmouse fully to appreciate the
fearful breach of etiquette of which he had just been guilty,
by swearing in such a presence. After they had bowed
to each other, a very awkward pause occurred, which was
at length broken by the considerate Lady Cecilia.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of the opera, Mr. Titmouse?"</p>

<p>"Very, my Lady&mdash;most particular," replied Titmouse,
who had been there once only.</p>

<p>"Do you prefer the opera, or the ballet? I mean the
music or the dancing?"</p>

<p>"Oh I understand your Ladyship. 'Pon my word, my
Lady, I prefer them both. The dancing is most uncommon
superior; though I must say, my Lady, the lady
dancers there do most uncommonly&mdash;<i>rather</i>, I should
say"&mdash;He stopped abruptly; his face flushed, and he felt
as if he had burst into a perspiration. What the deuce
was he about? It seemed as if some devil within were
urging him on, from time to time, to commit himself.
Good gracious! another word, and out would have come
his opinion as to the shocking indecency of the ballet!</p>

<p>"I understand you, sir; I quite agree with you," said
Lady Cecilia, calmly; "the ballet <i>does</i> come on at a sad
late hour; I often wish they would now and then have
the ballet first."</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, my Lady," quoth Titmouse, eagerly
snatching at the plank which had been thrown to him;
"that <i>is</i> what I meant&mdash;nothing else, upon my soul,
your Ladyship!"</p>

<p>"Do you intend taking a box there, Mr. Titmouse?"
inquired her Ladyship, with an appearance of interest in
the expected answer.</p>

<p>"Why, your Ladyship, they say a box there is a <i>precious</i>
long figure;&mdash;but in course, my Lady, when I've got to
rights a little with my property&mdash;your Ladyship understands&mdash;I
shall do the correct thing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Here a very long pause ensued. How dismally quiet
and deliberate was everything! The very servants, how
noiselessly they waited! Everything done just when it
was wanted, yet no hurry, or bustle, or noise; and they
looked so composed&mdash;so much at their ease. He fancied
that they had scarce anything else to do than look
at him, and watch all his movements; which greatly
embarrassed him, and he began to <i>hate</i> them. He tried
hard to inspirit himself with a reflection upon his own
suddenly acquired and really great personal importance;
absolute master of Ten Thousand a-Year, a relation of
the great man at whose table he sat, and whose hired
servants they were; but then his timorously raised eye
would light, for an instant, upon the splendid <i>insignia</i> of
the earl; and he felt as oppressed as ever. What would
he not have given for a few minutes' interval, and sense
of complete freedom and independence? And were these
to be his feelings ever hereafter? Was this the sort of
tremulous apprehension of offence, and embarrassment as
to his every move, to which he was to be doomed in high
life? Oh that he had but been <i>born</i> to it, like the earl
and the Lady Cecilia!</p>

<p>"Were you ever in the House of Lords, Mr. Titmouse?"
inquired Lord Dreddlington, suddenly, after casting about
for some little time for a topic on which he might converse
with Titmouse.</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, never&mdash;should most uncommon like to
see it, my Lord"&mdash;replied Titmouse, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Certainly, it is an impressive spectacle, sir, and well
worth seeing," said the earl, solemnly.</p>

<p>"I suppose, my Lord, your Lordship goes there every
day?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, I believe <i>I am</i> pretty punctual in my attendance.
I was there to-day, sir, till the House rose.
Sir, I am of opinion that hereditary legislators&mdash;a practical
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
anomaly in a free state like this&mdash;but one which
has innumerable unperceived advantages to recommend
it&mdash;Sir, our country expects at our hands, in discharge
of so grave a trust&mdash;in short, if we were not to be true
to&mdash;we who are in a peculiar sense the guardians of public
liberty&mdash;if we were once to betray our trust&mdash;Let
me trouble you sir, for a little of that&mdash;&mdash;," said the
earl, using some foreign word which Titmouse had never
heard of before, and looking towards a delicately constructed
fabric, as of compressed snow, which stood before
Titmouse. A servant was in a twinkling beside him,
with his Lordship's plate. Ah me! that I should have
to relate so sad an event as presently occurred to Titmouse!
He took a spoon; and, imagining the glistening
fabric before him to be as solid as it looked, brought
to bear upon it an adequate degree of force, even as if
he had been going to scoop out a piece of Stilton cheese&mdash;and
inserting his spoon at the summit of the snowy
and deceitful structure, souse to the bottom went spoon,
hand, coat-cuff, and all, and a very dismal noise evidenced
that the dish on which the aforesaid spoon had descended,
with so much force&mdash;was no longer a dish. It was,
in fact, broken in halves, and the liquid from within, ran
about on the cloth.... A cluster of servants was quickly
around him.... A mist came over his eyes; the
color deserted his cheek; and he had a strange feeling,
as if verily the end of all things was at hand.</p>

<p>"I beg you will think nothing of it&mdash;for it really signifies
nothing at all, Mr. Titmouse," said the earl, kindly,
observing his agitation.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! oh my Lord&mdash;your Ladyship&mdash;what an
<i>uncommon</i> stupid ass!" faltered Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Pray <i>don't</i> distress yourself, Mr. Titmouse," said Lady
Cecilia, really feeling for his evident misery, "or you will
distress <i>us</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg&mdash;humbly beg pardon&mdash;please your Lordship&mdash;your
Ladyship. I'll replace it with the best in London
the very first thing in the morning." Here the servant
beside him, who was arranging the table-cloth,
uttered a faint sound of suppressed laughter, which
disconcerted Titmouse still more.</p>

<p>"Give yourself no concern&mdash;'tis only a <i>trifle</i>, Mr.
Titmouse!&mdash;You understand, ha, ha?" said the earl,
kindly.</p>

<p>"But if your Lordship will only allow me&mdash;expense is
no object. I know the very best shop in Oxford Street."</p>

<p>"Suppose we take a glass of champagne together, Mr.
Titmouse?" said the earl, rather peremptorily; and Titmouse
had sense enough to be aware that he was to drop
the subject. It was a good while before he recovered
even the little degree of self-possession which he had had
since first entering Lord Dreddlington's house. He had
afterwards no very distinct recollection of the manner
in which he got through the rest of dinner, but a general
sense of his having been treated with the most kind
and delicate forbearance&mdash;no <i>fuss</i> made. Suppose such
an accident had occurred at Satin Lodge, or even Alibi
House!</p>

<p>Shortly after the servants had withdrawn, Lady Cecilia
rose to retire. Titmouse, seeing the earl approaching
the bell, anticipated him in ringing it, and then darted
to the door with the speed of a lamplighter to open it,
as he did, just before a servant had raised his hand to it
on the outside. Then he stood within, and the servant
without, each bowing, and Lady Cecilia passed between
them with stately step, her eyes fixed upon the ground,
and her lip compressed with the effort to check her inclination
to a smile&mdash;perhaps, even laughter. Titmouse
was now left alone with Lord Dreddlington; and, on
resuming his seat, most earnestly renewed his entreaties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
to be allowed to replace the dish which he had broken,
assuring Lord Dreddlington that "money was no object
at all." He was encountered, however, with so stern
a negative by his Lordship, that, with a hurried apology,
he dropped the subject; but the earl very good-naturedly
added that he had perceived the <i>joke</i> intended
by Mr. Titmouse&mdash;which was certainly a very good
one! This would have set off poor Titmouse again; but
a glance at the face of his magnificent host sealed his
lips.</p>

<p>"I have heard it said, Mr. Titmouse," presently commenced
the earl, "that you have been engaged in mercantile
pursuits during the period of your exclusion
from the estates which you have just recovered. Is it
so, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-e-s&mdash;sir&mdash;my Lord"&mdash;replied Titmouse, hastily
considering whether or not he should altogether <i>sink
the shop</i>; but he dared hardly venture upon so very decisive
a lie&mdash;"I was, please your Lordship, in one of the
greatest establishments in the mercery line in London&mdash;at
the west end, my Lord; most confidential, my Lord;
management of everything; but, somehow, my Lord, I
never <i>took to it</i>&mdash;always felt a cut above it&mdash;your Lordship
understands?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, sir; I can quite appreciate your feelings.
But, sir, the mercantile interests of this great country
are not to be overlooked!&mdash;Those who are concerned
in them, are frequently respectable persons."</p>

<p>"Begging pardon, my Lord&mdash;no, they a'n't&mdash;if your
Lordship only knew them as well as I do, my Lord. Most
uncommon low people. Do anything to turn a penny,
my Lord; and often sell damaged goods for best."</p>

<p>"It is very possible, sir, that there may exist irregularities,
<i>eccentricities</i>, ha! ha! of that description; but upon
the whole, sir, I am disposed to think that there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
many very decent persons engaged in trade. I have had
the happiness, sir, to assist in passing measures that were
calculated, by removing restrictions and protective duties,
to secure to this country the benefits of free and universal
competition. We have been proceeding, sir, for many
years, on altogether a wrong principle&mdash;that of protecting
native industry and enterprise; but, not to follow out
this matter farther, I must remind you, sir, that your acquaintance
with the principles and leading details of mercantile
transactions&mdash;undoubtedly one of the mainsprings
of the national greatness&mdash;may hereafter be of use to
you, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord, 'pon my soul&mdash;when I'm furnishing
my houses in town and country, I mean to go to market
myself&mdash;please your Lordship, I know a trick or two of
the trade, and can't be taken in, my Lord. For instance,
my Lord, there's Tag-rag&mdash;a-hem! hem!" he paused
abruptly, and looked somewhat confusedly at the earl.</p>

<p>"I did not mean <i>that</i> exactly," said his Lordship, unable
to resist a smile. "Pray, fill your glass, Mr. Titmouse."
He did so. "You are of course aware that
you have the absolute patronage of the borough of Yatton,
Mr. Titmouse?&mdash;It occurs to me, that as our political
opinions agree, and unless I am presumptuous, sir, in
so thinking&mdash;I may be regarded, in a political point of
view, as the head of the family&mdash;you understand me, I
hope, Mr. Titmouse?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, my Lord&mdash;'pon my soul, it's all correct,
my Lord."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;then, sir, the family interests, Mr. Titmouse,
must be looked after"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! in course, my Lord, only too happy&mdash;certainly,
my Lord, we shall, I hope, make a very <i>interesting</i> family,
if your Lordship so pleases&mdash;I <i>can</i> have no objection, my
Lord!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a vile, a disgraceful trick, by which Ministers
popped in their own man for our borough, Mr. Titmouse."</p>

<p>[Lord Dreddlington alluded to the circumstance of a
new writ having been moved for, immediately on Mr. Aubrey's
acceptance of the Chiltern Hundreds, and, before
the Opposition could be prepared for such a step, sent
down, without delay, to Yatton, and Sir Percival Pickering,
Bart., of Luddington Court, an intimate friend of Mr.
Aubrey's, and a keen unflinching Tory, being returned as
member, before the Titmouse influence could be brought
for even one moment into the field; the few and willing
electors of that ancient and loyal borough being only too
happy to have the opportunity of voting for a man whose
principles they approved&mdash;probably the last they would
have of doing so.]</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord&mdash;Sir What-d'ye-call-him <i>was</i> a trifle
too sharp for us, in that business, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"It has succeeded, sir, for the moment, but"&mdash;continued
his Lordship, in a very significant and stately manner&mdash;"it
is quite possible that their triumph may be of
very short duration&mdash;Mr. Titmouse. Those who, like
myself, are at headquarters&mdash;let me see you fill your
glass, Mr. Titmouse.&mdash;I have the honor to congratulate
you, sir, on the recovery of your rights, and to wish you
health and long life in the enjoyment of them," quoth the
earl, with an air of the loftiest urbanity.</p>

<p>"May it please your Lordship, your Lordship's most
uncommon polite"&mdash;commenced Titmouse, rising and
standing while he spoke&mdash;for he had had experience
enough of society, to be aware that when a gentleman's
health is drunk on important occasions, it becomes him
to rise and acknowledge the compliment in such language
as he can command&mdash;"and am particularly proud&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;I
beg to propose, my Lord, your Lordship's very
<i>superior</i> good health, and many thanks." Then he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
down; each poured out another glass of claret, and Titmouse
drank his off.</p>

<p>"It is extremely singular, sir," said the earl, musingly,
after a considerable pause, "the reverses in life that one
hears of!"</p>

<p>[I cannot help pausing, for a moment, to suggest&mdash;what
must have become of the earl and his daughter,
had they been placed in the situation of the unfortunate
Aubreys?]</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord, your Lordship's quite true, 'pon my
word!&mdash;Most uncommon <i>ups</i> and <i>downs!</i> Lord, my Lord,
only to fancy <i>me</i>, a few months ago, trotting up and down
Oxford Street with my yard mea"&mdash;&mdash;He stopped short,
and colored violently.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied the earl, with an expression of
bland and dignified sympathy&mdash;"however humble might
have been your circumstances, it is a consolation to reflect
that <i>the Fates ordained it</i>. Sir, there is nothing dishonorable
in being poor, when&mdash;you cannot help it! Reverses
of fortune, sir, have happened to some of the
greatest characters in our history. You remember Alfred,
sir?" Titmouse bowed assentingly; but had he
been questioned, could have told, I suspect, as little
about the matter&mdash;as the earl himself.</p>

<p>"Allow me, sir, to ask whether you have come to any
arrangement with your late opponent concerning the backrents?"
inquired the earl, with a great appearance of
interest.</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, not yet; but my solicitors say they'll
soon <i>have the screw on</i>, please your Lordship&mdash;that's just
what they say&mdash;their very words."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir!" replied the earl, gravely. "What is
the sum to which they say you are entitled, sir?"</p>

<p>"Sixty thousand pounds, my Lord, at least&mdash;quite
set me up at starting, my Lord&mdash;won't it?" replied
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Titmouse, with great glee; but the earl shuddered involuntarily
for a moment, and sipped his wine in silence.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Titmouse," said he, after a considerable
pause&mdash;"I trust you will forgive me for suggesting
whether it would not be a prudent step for you to go to
one of the universities, for at least a twelvemonth."</p>

<p>"Humbly begging your Lordship's pardon, am not I
too old? I've heard they're all a pack of overgrown
schoolboys there&mdash;and learn nothing but a bit of some
old languages that a'n't the least use now-a-days, seeing
it a'n't <i>spoke</i> now, anywhere"&mdash;replied Titmouse&mdash;"Besides,
I've talked the thing over with Mr. Gammon,
my Lord"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Gammon? Allow me, sir, to ask who that may
be?"</p>

<p>"One of my solicitors, my Lord; a most remarkable
clever man, and an out-and-out lawyer, my Lord. It was
he that found out all about my case, my Lord. If your
Lordship was only to see him for a moment, your Lordship
would say what a <i>remarkable</i> clever man that is!"</p>

<p>"You will forgive my curiosity, sir&mdash;but it must have
surely required very ample means to have carried on so
arduous a lawsuit as that which has just terminated so
successfully?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, my Lord!&mdash;Quirk, Gammon, and Snap did
all that; and, between me and your Lordship, I suppose
I shall have to come down a pretty long figure, all on the
<i>nail</i>, as your Lordship understands; but I mean them to
get it all out of that respectable gent, Mr. Aubrey!"&mdash;By
quietly pressing his questions, the earl got a good deal
more from Titmouse than he was aware of, concerning
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap; and in doing so, conceived
a special dislike for Gammon. The earl gave him
some pretty decisive hints about the necessity of being on
his guard with such people&mdash;and hoped that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
not commit himself to anything important without consulting
his Lordship, who would of course give him the
advantage of his experience in the affairs of the world,
and open his eyes to the designs of those whose only object
was to make a prey of him. Titmouse began to feel
that here, at length, he had met with a <i>real</i> friend&mdash;one
whose suggestions were worthy of being received with the
profoundest deference. Soon afterwards, he had the good
fortune to please the earl, beyond expression, by venturing
timidly to express his admiration of the splendid ribbon
worn by his Lordship; who took the opportunity of
explaining that and the other marks of distinction he
wore, and others which he was entitled to wear, at great
length and with much minuteness&mdash;so that he at length
caused Titmouse to believe that he, Lord Dreddlington&mdash;the
august head of the family&mdash;must have rendered
more signal service, somehow or other, to his country,
and also done more to win the admiration and gratitude
of foreign countries, than most men of former or present
times. His Lordship might not, perhaps, have intended
it; but he went on till he had almost <small>DEIFIED</small> himself in
the estimation of his little listener!&mdash;One very natural
question was perpetually trembling on the tip of Titmouse's
tongue; viz. how and when he could get such
things for <i>himself</i>.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Titmouse," at length observed the earl,
after looking at his watch&mdash;"shall we adjourn to the
drawing-room? The fact is, sir, that Lady Cecilia and I
have an evening engagement at the Duchess of Diamond's.
I much regret being unable to take you with us, sir; but,
as it is, shall we rejoin the Lady Cecilia?" continued his
Lordship, rising. Up jumped Titmouse; and the earl and
he were soon in the drawing-room; where, besides the
Lady Cecilia, sat another lady, to whom he was not introduced
in any way. This was Miss Macspleuchan, a distant
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
connection of the earl's late countess&mdash;a very poor
relation, who had entered the house of the Earl of Dreddlington,
in order to eat the bitter, bitter bread of dependence.
Poor soul! you might tell, by a glance at her,
that she had not thriven upon it. She was about thirty,
and so thin! She was dressed in plain white muslin;
and there was a manifest constraint and timidity about
her motions, and a depression in her countenance; whose
lineaments showed that if she could have been happy, she
might have appeared handsome. She had a most ladylike
air; and there was thought in her brow and acuteness
in her eye, which however, as it were, habitually watched
the motions of the earl and the Lady Cecilia, with deference
and anxiety. Poor Miss Macspleuchan felt herself
gradually sinking into a sycophant; the alternative being
<i>that</i>, or starvation. She was very accomplished, particularly
in music and languages, while the Lady Cecilia
really knew scarcely anything&mdash;for which reason, principally,
she had long ago conceived a bitter dislike to Miss
Macspleuchan, and inflicted on her a number of petty but
exquisite mortifications and indignities; such, perhaps, as
none but a sensitive soul could fully appreciate; for the
earl and his daughter were exemplary persons in the proprieties
of life, and would not do such things <i>openly</i>. She
was a sort of companion of Lady Cecilia, and entirely dependent
upon her and the earl for her subsistence. She
was sitting on the sofa beside Lady Cecilia, when Titmouse
re-entered the drawing-room; and the latter eyed
him through her glass with infinite <i>nonchalance</i>, even
when he had advanced to within a few feet of her. He
made Miss Macspleuchan, as she rose to take her seat and
prepare tea, a most obsequious bow. Absurd as was the
style of its performance, she saw that there was politeness
in the intention; 'twas moreover a courtesy towards
herself, that was unusual from the earl's guests; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
these considerations served to take off the edge of the
ridicule and contempt with which Lady Cecilia had been
preparing her to receive their newly-discovered kinsman.
After standing for a second or two near the sofa, Titmouse
ventured to sit himself down upon it&mdash;on the very edge
only&mdash;as if afraid of disturbing Lady Cecilia, who was
reclining on it with an air of languid hauteur.</p>

<p>"So you're going, my Lady, to a dance to-night, as my
Lord says?" quoth Titmouse, respectfully; "hope your
Ladyship will enjoy yourself!"</p>

<p>"We regret that you do not accompany us, Mr. Titmouse,"
said Lady Cecilia, slightly inclining towards him,
and glancing at Miss Macspleuchan with a faint and bitter
smile.</p>

<p>"Should have been most uncommon proud to have
gone, please your Ladyship," replied Titmouse, as a servant
brought him a cup of tea. "These cups and saucers,
my Lady, come from abroad, I suppose? Now, I dare
say, though they've <i>rather</i> a funny look, they cost a
good deal?"</p>

<p>"I really do not know, sir; I believe we have had
them some time."</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, my Lady, I like them amazing!" Seeing
her Ladyship not disposed to talk, Titmouse became
silent.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of music, Mr. Titmouse?" inquired the
earl, presently; observing that the pause in the conversation
had become embarrassing to Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Very, indeed, my Lord; is your Lordship?"</p>

<p>"I am rather fond of <i>vocal</i> music, sir&mdash;of the opera."</p>

<p>This the earl said, because Miss Macspleuchan played
upon the piano very brilliantly, and did not sing. Miss
Macspleuchan understood him.</p>

<p>"Do you play upon any instrument, Mr. Titmouse?"
inquired Lady Cecilia, with a smile lurking about her lips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
which increased a little when Titmouse replied in the negative;&mdash;but
added that, he had once begun to learn the
<i>clarionet</i> some years before, but could not manage the
notes. "Excuse me, my Lady, but what an uncommon
fine piano that is!" said he.&mdash;"If I may make so bold,
will your Ladyship give us a tune?"</p>

<p>"I dare say Miss Macspleuchan will play for you, Mr.
Titmouse, if you wish it," replied Lady Cecilia, coldly.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards, a servant announced to her
Ladyship and the earl that the carriage was at the door;
and presently they both retired to their dressing-rooms to
make some slight alteration in their dress;&mdash;the earl to
add an order or two, and Lady Cecilia to place upon her
haughty brow a small tiara of brilliants. As soon as they
had thus retired&mdash;"I shall feel great pleasure, sir, in
playing for you, if you wish it," said Miss Macspleuchan,
in a voice of such mingled melancholy and kindness as
must have gone to Titmouse's heart, had he possessed
one. He jumped up, and bowed profoundly. She sat
down to the piano, and played with great ease and brilliancy
such music as she supposed would suit her auditor&mdash;namely,
waltzes and marches&mdash;till the door opened,
and Lady Cecilia reappeared drawing on her gloves, with
the glittering addition which I have mentioned&mdash;followed
presently by the earl.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said he, with dignified affability, "I need
not repeat how highly gratified I feel at our introduction
to each other. I trust you will henceforth consider yourself
no stranger here"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, 'pon my life, my Lord! your Lordship's most
particular polite!" exclaimed Titmouse, in a low tone,
and with a sudden and profound bow.</p>

<p>"And that on your return from Yorkshire," continued
the earl, drawing on his gloves, "you will let us see you:
we both feel great interest in your good fortunes. Sir, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
have the honor to wish you a good evening!" He extended
his gloved hand to his distinguished little kinsman,
whose hand, however, he touched with little more
than the ends of his fingers.</p>

<p>"We exceedingly regret that we must leave you, Mr.
Titmouse," said Lady Cecilia, with forced seriousness;
"but as we wish to leave the duchess's early, in order to
go to another ball, we must <i>go</i> early. Good-evening, sir,"
and having dropped him a slight formal courtesy, she
quitted the drawing-room followed by the earl, Titmouse
making four or five such bows as provoked a smile from
all who witnessed them. The next moment he was alone
with Miss Macspleuchan. Her unaffected, good-natured
address made him feel more at home within the next five
minutes, than he had been since entering that frigid scene
of foolish state&mdash;since being in the oppressive presence
of the greatness just departed. She felt at first a contempt
for him bordering upon disgust, but which very
soon melted into pity. What a wretched creature was
<i>this</i> to be put into such a dazzling position! What might
be the design of Providence in placing such a being in the
possession of such wealth and rank, at the expense of the
virtuous Aubreys?</p>

<p>Titmouse soon got pretty communicative with Miss Macspleuchan,
and told her about the Tag-rags, Miss Tag-rag,
and Miss Quirk, both of whom were absolutely dying of
love for him, and thought he was in love with them, which
was not the case&mdash;far from it. Then he hinted something
about a most particular uncommon lovely gal that
had his heart, and he hoped to have hers, as soon as he
had got all to rights at Yatton. Then he described the
splendid style in which he was going down to take possession
of his estates. Having finished this, he told her
that he had been the morning before to see a man hanged
for murdering his wife; that he had been into the condemned
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
cell, and then into the press-room, and had seen
his hands and arms tied, and shaken hands with him; and
he was going into such a sickening minuteness of detail,
that to avoid it Miss Macspleuchan, who felt both shocked
and disgusted, suddenly asked him if he was fond of heraldry;
and rising from the sofa, she went into the second
room, where, on an elegant and antique stand, lay a huge
roll of parchment, on a gilded stick, splendidly mounted
and most superbly illuminated,&mdash;it was about three-quarters
of a yard in breadth, and some ten or twenty
feet in length. This was the <i>Pedigree of the Dreddlingtons</i>.
She was giving him an account of Simon de Drelincourt,
an early ancestor of the earl's, who had come over with
William the Conqueror, and performed stupendous feats
of valor at the battle of Hastings, Titmouse listening in
open-mouthed awe, and almost trembling to think that
he had broken a valuable dish belonging to a nobleman
who had such wonderful ancestors; not, at the moment,
adverting to the circumstance that he was himself descended
from the very same ancestors, and had as rich
blood in him as the earl and Lady Cecilia&mdash;when a servant
entered and informed him in a whisper that "his
carriage had arrived." He considered that etiquette required
him to depart immediately.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon; but if ever you should come down
to my estate in the country, shall be most uncommon
proud to see your Ladyship."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; you are mistaken, sir," interrupted
Miss Macspleuchan, hastily, and blushing scarlet;
the fact being that Titmouse had not caught her name on
its having been once or twice pronounced by Lady Cecilia;
and very naturally concluded that she also must be a
lady of rank. Titmouse was, however, so occupied with his
efforts to make a graceful exit, that he did not catch the
explanation of his mistake; and, bowing almost down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the ground, reached the landing, where the tall servant,
with a very easy grace, gave him his hat and cane, and
preceded him down-stairs. As he descended, he felt in
his pockets for some loose silver, and gave several shillings
between the servants who stood in the hall to
witness his departure; after which, one of them having
opened the door and gently let down the steps of the
glass-coach, Titmouse popped into it.</p>

<p>"Home, sir?" inquired the servant, as he closed the
door.</p>

<p>"The Cabbage-Stalk Hotel, Covent Garden," replied
Titmouse, with an affected drawl.</p>

<p>His answer was communicated to the coachman, who
thereupon addressed a sharp argument to the brace of
meek and skinny horses, standing with downcast heads
before him&mdash;which they lifted up&mdash;then they got into
motion&mdash;and away rumbled the glass-coach. As soon as
its distinguished inmate had become calm enough to
reflect upon the events of the evening, he came to the
conclusion that the Earl of Dreddlington was a very great
man indeed; the Lady Cecilia very beautiful, but rather
proud; and Miss Macspleuchan (Lady Somebody, as he
supposed) one of the most interesting ladies whom he
had ever met with; that there was something <i>uncommon</i>
pleasing about her: in short, he felt a sort of grateful
attachment towards her; but how long it would have
lasted after his hearing that she was only a plain
miss, and a poor relation, I leave the acute reader to
conjecture.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>Mr. Gammon was with Titmouse about half-past nine
o'clock the next morning, not a little anxious to hear how
that young gentleman had got on over-night; but met
with a totally different reception from any that he had
before experienced.</p>

<p>He imagined for a few minutes that Lord Dreddlington
had been <i>pumping</i> Titmouse; had learned from him his
position with respect to Gammon, in particular; and had
injected distrust and suspicion into the mind of Titmouse,
concerning him. But Gammon, with all his acuteness,
was quite mistaken. The truth was, 'twas only an attempt
on the part of poor Titmouse to assume the composed
demeanor, the languid elegance, which he had
observed in the distinguished personages with whom he
had spent the preceding evening, and which had made a
very deep impression on his little mind. He drawled out
his words, looked as if he were half asleep, and continually
addressed Gammon as "Sir," and "Mr. Gammon,"
just as the Earl of Dreddlington had constantly addressed
him&mdash;Titmouse. Our friend was sitting at breakfast, on
the present occasion, in a most gaudy dressing-gown, and
with the newspaper before him; in short, his personal appearance
and manner were totally different from what
Gammon had ever previously witnessed; and he looked
now and then at Titmouse, as if for a moment doubting
his identity. Whether or not he was now on the point of
throwing overboard those who had piloted him from amid
the shoals of poverty into the open sea of affluence, shone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
upon by the vivid sunlight of rank and distinction, Gammon
did not know; but he contracted his brow, and assumed
a certain sternness and peremptoriness of tone and
bearing, which were not long in reducing Titmouse to his
proper dimensions; and when at length Mr. Gammon
entered upon the delightful subject of the morrow's expedition,
telling him that he, Gammon, had now nearly
completed all the preparations for going down to, and taking
possession of Yatton in a style of suitable splendor,
according to the wish of Titmouse&mdash;this quickly melted
away the thin coating of mannerism, and Titmouse was
"himself again." He immediately gave Mr. Gammon a
full account of what had happened at Lord Dreddlington's,
and, I fear, of a great deal more, which <i>might</i>, possibly,
have happened, but certainly <i>had</i> not, <i>e. g.</i> his Lordship's
special laudation of Mr. Gammon as a "monstrous fine
lawyer," which Titmouse swore were the very exact words
of his Lordship, who "would have been most happy to
see Mr. Gammon," and a good deal to the like effect. Also
that he&mdash;Titmouse&mdash;had been "most uncommon thick"
with "Lady Cicely," (so he pronounced her name;) and
that both she and Lord Dreddlington had "pressed him
very hard to go with them to a ball <i>at a duke's</i>!" He
made no mention of the broken trifle-dish; said they had
nearly a dozen servants to wait on them, and that there
were twenty different sorts of wine, and no end of courses,
at dinner. That the earl wore a star, and garter, and
ribbons&mdash;which Gammon erroneously thought as apocryphal
as the rest; and had told him that he&mdash;Titmouse&mdash;might
one day wear them, and sit in the House of
Lords; and had, moreover, advised him most strenuously
to get into Parliament as soon as possible, as the "cause
of the people wanted strengthening." [As Lord Coke,
somewhere says, in speaking of a spurious portion of the
text of Lyttleton, "<i>that arrow came never out of Lyttleton's</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
<i>quiver</i>"&mdash;so Gammon instantly perceived that the last
sentence came never out of Titmouse's own head, but
came plainly marked as that of a wise and able man and
statesman.]</p>

<p>As soon as Titmouse had finished his little romance,
Gammon proceeded to the chief object of his visit&mdash;their
next day's journey. He said that he much regretted to
inform Titmouse that Mr. Snap had expressed a very
anxious wish to witness the triumph of Mr. Titmouse;
and that unless he had some particular objection&mdash;"Oh
none, 'pon honor!&mdash;poor Snap!&mdash;devilish good chap in
a small way!" said Titmouse, in a most condescending
manner, and at once gave his consent&mdash;Gammon informing
him that Mr. Snap would be obliged to return to
town by the next day's coach. The reader will smile
when I tell him, and if a lady, will frown when she hears,
that Miss Quirk was to be of the party&mdash;a point which
her anxious father had secured some time before. Mrs.
Alias had declared that she saw no objection, as Mr. Quirk
would be constantly with his daughter, and Gammon had
appeared most ready to bring about so desirable a result.
He had also striven hard, unknown to his partners, to
increase their numbers, by the Tag-rags, who might have
gone down, all three of them, if they had chosen, by coach,
and so have returned. Gammon conceived that this step
might not have been unattended with advantage in several
ways; and would, moreover, have secured him a considerable
source of amusement. Titmouse, however, would not
listen to the thing for one moment, and Gammon was
forced to give up his little scheme. Two dashing young
fellows, fashionable friends of Titmouse, (who had picked
them up, Heaven only knows where, but they never deserted
him,) infinitely to Gammon's annoyance, were to
be of the party. He had seen them but once, when he
had accompanied Titmouse to the play, where they soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
joined him. One was a truly disgusting-looking fellow&mdash;a
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pimp Yahoo</span>&mdash;a man about five-and-thirty years old,
tall, with a profusion of black hair parted down the middle
of his head, and falling down in long clustering curls
from each temple upon his coat-collar. His whiskers also
were ample, and covered two-thirds of his face, and spread
in disgusting amplitude round his throat. He had also a
jet-black tuft&mdash;an imperial&mdash;depending from his underlip.
He had an execrable eye&mdash;full of insolence and
sensuality; in short, his whole countenance bespoke the
thorough debauchee and ruffian. He had been, he said,
in the army; and was nearly connected, according to his
own account&mdash;as with fellows of this description is generally
the case&mdash;with "some of the first families in the
North!" He was now a man of pleasure about town&mdash;which
contained not a better billiard-player, as the admiring
Titmouse had had several painful opportunities of
judging. He was a great patron of the ring&mdash;knowing
all their secrets&mdash;all their haunts. He always had plenty
of the money of other people, and drove about in a most
elegant cab, in which Titmouse had often had a seat;
and as soon as Mr. Yahoo had extracted from his communicative
little companion all about himself, that astute
gentleman made it his business to conciliate Titmouse's
good graces by all the arts of which he was master&mdash;and
he succeeded. The other chosen companion of our friend
was Mr. <span class="smcap">Algernon Fitz-Snooks</span>; a complete fool. He
was the sole child of a rich tradesman&mdash;who had christened
him by the sounding name given above; and afterwards
added the patrician prefix to the surname, which
also you see above, in order to gratify his wife and son.
The youth had never "taken to business"&mdash;but was
allowed to saunter about, doing, and knowing, nothing,
till about his twenty-second year, when his mother died,
as also a year afterwards did his father, bequeathing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
his hopeful son some fifty thousand pounds&mdash;absolutely
and uncontrolledly. Mr. Algernon Fitz-Snooks very judiciously
thought that youth was the time to enjoy life;
and before he had reached his thirtieth year, he had
got through all his fortune except about five or six thousand
pounds&mdash;in return for which, he had certainly got
<i>something</i>; viz. an impaired constitution and a little experience,
which <i>might</i>, possibly, at some future time,
be useful. He had a pleasing face, regular features,
and interesting eyes; his light hair curled "deliciously;"
and he spoke in a sort of lisp and in a low tone&mdash;and,
in point of dress, always "turned out" beautifully. <i>He</i>,
also, had a cab, and was a great friend of Mr. Yahoo, who
had introduced him into a great deal of high society,
principally in St. James's Street; where both he and
Mr. Yahoo had passed a great deal of their time, especially
during the night! There was no intentional <i>mischief</i>
in poor Fitz-Snooks: nature had made him only a
fool&mdash;his prudent parents had done the rest; and if he
fell into vice, it was only because&mdash;as people say&mdash;"he
couldn't help it." Such were the chosen companions of
Titmouse; the one a fool, the other a rogue&mdash;and "he
<i>must</i>," he said, "have them down to the <i>jollifying</i> at
Yatton." A groom and a valet&mdash;both impudent knaves,
and both newly hired the day before&mdash;would complete
the party of the morrow. Gammon assured Titmouse
that he had taken all the pains in the world to get up a
triumphant entry into Yatton; his agents at Grilston,
Messrs. Bloodsuck and Son&mdash;the Radical electioneering
attorneys of the county&mdash;who were well versed in the
matter of processions, bands, flags, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., had by
that time arranged everything, and they were to be met,
when within a mile of Yatton, by a grand procession.
The people at the Hall, also, were under orders from Mr.
Gammon, through Messrs. Bloodsuck and Son, to have all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
in readiness&mdash;and a banquet prepared for nearly a hundred
persons&mdash;in fact, all comers were to be welcome.
To all this Titmouse listened with eyes glistening, and
ears tingling with rapture; but can any tongue describe
his emotion, on being apprised that the sum of £2,500,
in the banker's hands, was now at his disposal&mdash;that it
would be doubled in a few weeks&mdash;and that a check for
£500, drawn by Mr. Titmouse on the London agents of
the Grilston bankers, had been honored on the preceding
afternoon? Titmouse's heart beat fast, and he felt as if
he could have worshipped Gammon. As for the matter
of carriages, Mr. Gammon said, that probably Mr. Titmouse
would call that morning on Mr. Axle, in Long
Acre, and select one to his mind&mdash;it must of course be
one with two seats&mdash;and Mr. Gammon had pointed out
several which were, he thought, eligible, and would be
shown to Mr. Titmouse. That would be the carriage in
which&mdash;he presumed&mdash;Mr. Titmouse himself would
travel; the second, Mr. Gammon had taken the liberty
of already selecting. With this, Mr. Gammon (just as
the new valet brought in no fewer than a dozen boxes
of cigars ordered over-night by Titmouse) shook his hand
and departed, saying that he should make his appearance
at the Cabbage-Stalk the next morning, precisely at
eleven o'clock&mdash;about which time it was arranged they
were all to start. Titmouse hardly knew how to contain
himself, on being left alone. About an hour afterwards,
he made his appearance at Mr. Axle's: who, worthy and
indefatigable man, carried on two businesses, one public,
<i>i. e.</i> that of a coach-builder&mdash;one private, <i>i. e.</i> that of a
money-lender. He was a rich man&mdash;a very obliging and
"accommodating" person, by means of which latter quality
he had amassed a fortune of, it was believed, a hundred
thousand pounds. He never made a fuss about
selling on credit&mdash;or lending, taking back, or exchanging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
carriages of all descriptions; nor in discounting the bills
of his customers, to any amount. He proved generally
right, in each case, in the long rim. He would supply
his fashionable victim with as splendid a chariot, and
funds to keep it some time going, as he or she could desire;
well knowing that in due time, after they should
have taken a few turns in it about the parks, and a few
streets and squares in the neighborhood, it would quietly
drive up to one or two huge dingy fabrics in a different
part of the town, where it would deposit its burden, and
then return to its maker very little the worse for wear;
who took it back at about a twentieth part of its cost,
and soon again disposed of it in a way equally advantageous
to himself. Mr. Axle showed Mr. Titmouse very
obsequiously over his premises, pointing out (as soon as
he knew who his visitor was,) the carriages which Mr.
Gammon had the day before desired should be shown to
him; and which Mr. Titmouse, with his glass stuck in
his eye&mdash;where it was kept by the pure force of muscular
contraction&mdash;examined with something like the air
of a connoisseur&mdash;occasionally rapping with his agate-headed
cane&mdash;now against his teeth, then against his
legs. He did not seem perfectly satisfied with any of
them; they looked&mdash;he said&mdash;"devilish plain and
dull."</p>

<p>"Hollo&mdash;Mr. Axletree, or whatever your name is&mdash;what
have we <i>here</i>? 'Pon my soul, the very thing!"&mdash;he
exclaimed, as his eye caught a splendid object&mdash;the
state-carriage of the ex-sheriff, with its gorgeously
decorated panels: which, having been vamped up for
some six or seven successive shrievalties&mdash;(being on
each occasion heralded to the public by laudatory paragraphs
in the newspapers, as entirely new and signal instances
of the taste and magnificence of the sheriff-elect)&mdash;seemed
now <i>perfunctus officio</i>. Mr. Axle was staggered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
for a moment, and scarce supposed Mr. Titmouse to be in
earnest&mdash;Gammon having given him no inkling of the
real character of Titmouse; but observing the earnest
steadfast gaze with which he regarded the glittering object,
having succeeded in choking down a sudden fit of
laughter, Mr. Axle commenced a most seductive eulogium
upon the splendid structure&mdash;remarking on the singularity
of the circumstance of its happening just at
that exact moment to be placed at his disposal by its
former owner&mdash;a gentleman of great distinction, who
had no longer any occasion for it. Mr. Axle declared
that he had had numerous applications for it already;
on hearing which, Titmouse got excited. The door
was opened&mdash;he got in; sat on each seat&mdash;"Don't it
hang beautifully?" inquired the confident proprietor,
testing, by pressure, the elasticity of the springs, as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Let me see, who was it that was after it yesterday?
Oh&mdash;I think it was Sir Fitzbiscuit Gander; but I've not
<i>closed</i> with him yet!"</p>

<p>"What's your price, Mr. Axletree?" inquired Titmouse,
rather heatedly, as he got out of the carriage.</p>

<p>After some little higgle-haggling he bought it!!!&mdash;for
there was nothing like closing at once, where there
was keen competition! Mr. Gammon&mdash;thought Titmouse&mdash;could
not have seen this beautiful vehicle when
making his choice on the preceding morning! For the
rest of the day he felt infinitely elated at his fortunate
purchase; and excited his imagination by pictures of the
astonishment and admiration which his equipage must
call forth on the morrow. Punctual to his appointment,
Mr. Gammon, a few moments before the clock had struck
eleven on the ensuing morning, drew up to the Cabbage-Stalk,
as near at least as he could get to it, in a hackney-coach,
with his portmanteau and carpet-bag. I say as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
near as he could; for round about the door stood a little
crowd, gazing with a sort of awe on a magnificent vehicle
standing there, with four horses harnessed to it. Gammon
looked at his watch, as he entered the hotel, and
asked why the sheriff's carriage was standing at the door.
The waiter to whom he spoke, seemed nearly splitting
with laughter, which almost disabled him from answering
that the carriage in question was that of Mr. Titmouse,
ready for setting off for Yorkshire. Mr. Gammon started
back&mdash;turned pale, and seemed nearly dropping an umbrella
which was in his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Titmouse's!" he echoed incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;been here for this hour, at least, packing,
such a crowd all the while; everybody thinks it's the
sheriff, sir," replied the waiter, scarce able to keep his
countenance. Mr. Gammon rushed up-stairs with greater
impetuosity than he had perhaps ever been known
to exhibit before, and burst into Mr. Titmouse's room.
There was that gentleman, with his hat on, his hands
stuck into his coat-pockets, a cigar in his mouth, and a
tumbler of brandy and water before him. Mr. Yahoo,
Mr. Fitz-Snooks, and Mr. Snap were similarly occupied;
and Mr. Quirk was sitting down with his hands in his
pockets, and a glass of negus before him, with anything
but a joyful expression of countenance.</p>

<p>"Is it possible, Mr. Titmouse"&mdash;&mdash;commenced Gammon,
almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Ah, how d'ye do, Gammon?&mdash;punctual!" interrupted
Titmouse, extending his hand.</p>

<p>"Forgive me&mdash;but can it be, that the monstrous thing
now before the door, with a crowd grinning around it, is
<i>your carriage</i>?" inquired Gammon, with dismay in his
face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;rather&mdash;think&mdash;it <i>is</i>," replied Titmouse, slightly
disconcerted, but striving to look self-possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"My <i>dear</i> sir," replied Gammon, in a kind of agony,
"it is <i>impossible!</i> It never can be! Do you mean to
say that you bought it at Mr. Axle's?"</p>

<p>"I should rather think so," replied Titmouse, with a
piqued air.</p>

<p>"He's been grossly imposing on you, sir!&mdash;Permit me
to go at once and get you a proper vehicle."</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, Mr. Gammon, <i>I</i> think that it's a monstrous
nice thing&mdash;a great bargain&mdash;and I've bought
it and paid for it, that's more."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I appeal to <i>you</i>," confidently said Gammon,
turning in an agony to Mr. Yahoo and Mr. Fitz-Snooks.</p>

<p>"As for <i>me</i>, sir," replied the former, coolly, at the same
time knocking off the ashes from his cigar;&mdash;"since you
ask my opinion, I confess I rather like the idea&mdash;ha!
ha! 'Twill produce a <i>sensation</i>; that's something in
this dull life!&mdash;Eh, Snooks?"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;a&mdash;I confess I was a little shocked at first,
but I think I'm getting over it now," lisped Mr. Fitz-Snooks,
adjusting his shirt-collar, and then sipping a little
of his brandy and water. "I look upon it, now, as an
excellent joke; egad, it beats Chitterfield hollow, though
<i>he</i>, too, has done a trick or two lately."</p>

<p>"Did you purchase it as a joke, Mr. Titmouse?" inquired
Gammon, with forced calmness, nearly choked
with suppressed fury.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;a&mdash;'pon my life"&mdash;said Titmouse, with a
desperate effort to appear at his ease&mdash;"if you ask <i>me</i>&mdash;wonder
you don't see it! Of course I did!&mdash;Those that
don't like it may ride, you know, in the other&mdash;can't
they? Eh?"</p>

<p>"We shall be hooted at, laughed at, wherever we go,"
said Mr. Gammon, vehemently.</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;that's the <i>novelty</i> I like," said Mr. Yahoo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
looking, as he spoke, at Mr. Gammon with a smile of
ineffable insolence.</p>

<p>Mr. Gammon made him no reply, but fixed an eye upon
him, under which he became plainly rather uneasy. He
felt outdone. Talk of <small>SCORN</small>!&mdash;the eye of Gammon,
settled at that instant upon Mr. Yahoo, was its complete
and perfect representative; and from that moment the
wretch Yahoo felt something like <i>fear</i> of the eye of man,
or of <i>submission</i> to it. When, moreover, he beheld the
manner in which Titmouse obeyed Gammon's somewhat
peremptory request to accompany him out of the room
for a moment, he resolved, if possible, to make a friend
of Gammon. That gentleman failed, on being alone with
Titmouse, in shaking his resolution to travel in the
splendid vehicle standing at the door. Titmouse said
that he had bought and paid for the carriage; it suited
his taste&mdash;and where was the harm of gratifying it?
Besides, it was already packed&mdash;all was prepared for
starting. Gammon thereupon gave it up; and, swallowing
down his rage as well, and as quickly as he could,
endeavored to reconcile himself to this galling and most
unexpected predicament.</p>

<p>It seemed that Miss Quirk, however really anxious to
go down to Yatton&mdash;to do anything, in short, calculated
to commit Mr. Titmouse to her&mdash;was quite staggered on
discovering, and shocked at seeing, the kind of persons
who were to be their travelling companions. As for Mr.
Yahoo, she recoiled from him with horror at the very
first glance. What decent female, indeed, would not
have done so? She had retired to a bedchamber, soon
after entering the Cabbage-Stalk; and, seeing her two
unexpected fellow-travellers, presently sent a chambermaid
to request her papa to come to her.</p>

<p>He found her considerably agitated. She wished earnestly
to return to Alibi House; and consented to proceed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
on her journey only on the express promise of Mr.
Titmouse and her papa, that no one should be in the
carriage in which she went except her papa and Mr. Gammon&mdash;unless,
indeed, Mr. Titmouse should think proper
to make himself the fourth.</p>

<p>Mr. Quirk, on this, sent for Mr. Gammon, who, with
a somewhat bad grace, ("Confound it!" thought he,
"everything seems going wrong,") undertook to secure
Mr. Titmouse's consent to that arrangement.</p>

<p>While Messrs. Quirk and Gammon were closeted together,
one of the waiters entered the room occupied by
Mr. Titmouse and his friends, and informed him that a
lad had brought a parcel for him, which he, the aforesaid
lad, had received special orders to deliver into the hands
of Mr. Titmouse. Accordingly there was presently shown
into the room a little knock-kneed lad, in tarnished livery,
in whom Titmouse recollected the boy belonging to
Mr. Tag-rag's one-horse chaise; and who gave a small
parcel into Mr. Titmouse's hands, "with Mrs. and Miss
Tag-rag's respectful respects."</p>

<p>As soon as he had quitted the room, "By Jove! What
have we here?" exclaimed Titmouse, just a <i>little</i> flustered
as he cut open the string of the parcel. Inside was a
packet wrapped up in white paper, and tied in a pretty
bow, with narrow white satin ribbons. This again, and
another still, within it, having been opened&mdash;behold,
there stood exposed to view, three fine cambric pocket-handkerchiefs,
each of which, on being examined, proved
to be marked with the initials "T. T." in <i>hair</i>; and Mr.
Yahoo happening to unfold one of them, (in so doing,
dropped upon it some of the ashes of his cigar,) lo! in
the centre was&mdash;also done in hair&mdash;the figure of a heart
transfixed with an arrow!!! Mr. Yahoo roared; and
Mr. Fitz-Snooks lisped, "Is she pretty, Tit? Where's
her nest? Any <i>old</i> birds?&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Titmouse colored a little; then grinned, and put his
finger to the side of his nose, and winked his eye, as if
favoring the bright idea of Mr. Fitz-Snooks. On a sheet
of gilt-edged paper, and sealed with a seal bearing the tender
words, "<i>Forget me not</i>," was written the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;Trusting you will excuse the liberty, I send you
three best cambric pocket-handkerchiefs, which my daughter
have marked with her own hair, and beg your acceptance of,
hoping you may be resigned to all the good fortune that may
befall you, which is the prayer of, dear sir, yours respectfully,</p>

<div align="right"> "<span class="smcap">Martha Tag-rag</span>. </div>

<p>"P. S.&mdash;My daughter sends what you may please to wish
and accept: and hope we have the great happiness to see you
here again, when you return to town from your noble mansion
in the country.</p>

<div align="left"> "<i>Satin Lodge, 18th May 18&mdash;.</i>" </div>
</blockquote>

<p>"Oh! the naughty old woman! Fie! Fie!" exclaimed
Mr. Yahoo, with his intolerable smile.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, there's nothing in it," said Titmouse,
reddening.</p>

<p>"Where's Satin Lodge?" lisped Mr. Fitz-Snooks.</p>

<p>"It is a country-house on the&mdash;the Richmond road,"
said Titmouse, with a little hesitation; and just then the
return of Gammon, who had resumed his usual calmness
of manner, relieved him from his embarrassment. Mr.
Gammon had succeeded in effecting the arrangement suggested
by Mr. Quirk and his daughter; and within about
a quarter of an hour afterwards, behold the ex-sheriff's
resplendent but cast-off carriage filled by Miss Quirk and
Titmouse, and Mr. Quirk and Gammon&mdash;the groom and
valet sitting on the coach-box; while in the other, a plain
yellow carriage, covered with luggage, sat Mr. Yahoo,
Mr. Fitz-Snooks, and Mr. Snap, all of them with lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
cigars&mdash;Snap never having been so happy in all his life
as at that moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Titmouse had laid aside his cigar in compliment to
Miss Quirk; who wore a long black veil, and an elegant
light shawl, and looked uncommonly like a young bride
setting off&mdash;oh, heavens!&mdash;thought she&mdash;that it <i>had</i>
been so!&mdash;on her wedding excursion. Mr. Gammon
slouched his hat over his eyes, and inclined his head
downwards, almost collapsed with vexation and disgust,
as he observed the grins and tittering of the group of
spectators gathered round the carriage and doorway;
but Titmouse, who was most splendidly dressed, took off
his hat on sitting down, and bowed several times to&mdash;as
he supposed&mdash;the admiring crowd.</p>

<p>"Get on, boys!" growled Mr. Gammon; and away
they rattled, exciting equal surprise and applause whereever
they went. Whoever had met them, must have
taken Titmouse and Miss Quirk for a newly-married
couple&mdash;probably the son or daughter of one of the
sheriffs who had lent the state carriage to add <i>éclat</i> to
the interesting occasion!</p>

<p>With the exception of the sensation produced at every
place where they changed horses, the only incident during
their journey worth noticing, occurred at the third
stage from London. As they came dashing up to the
door of the inn, their advent setting all the bells of the
establishment ringing, and waiters and hostlers scampering
up to them like mad, they beheld a plain and laden
dusty travelling-carriage, waiting for horses&mdash;and Gammon
quickly perceived it to be the carriage of the unfortunate
Aubreys! The travellers had alighted. The graceful
figure of Miss Aubrey, her face pale, and wearing an expression
of manifest anxiety and fatigue, was standing
near the door, talking kindly to a beggar-woman, with
a cluster of half-naked children around her; while little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Aubrey was romping about with Miss Aubrey's beautiful
little spaniel Cato; Agnes looking on and laughing merrily,
and trying to escape from the hand of her attendant.
Mr. and Mrs. Aubrey were talking together, close beside
the carriage-door. Gammon observed all this, and particularly
that Mr. Aubrey was scrutinizing their appearance,
with a sort of half-smile on his countenance, melancholy
as it was.</p>

<p>"Horses on!" said Gammon, leaning back in the
carriage.</p>

<p>"That's a monstrous fine woman standing at the inn
door, Titmouse&mdash;eh?" exclaimed Mr. Yahoo, who had
alighted for a moment, and stood beside the door of Titmouse's
carriage, his execrable eye settled upon Miss Aubrey.
"I wonder who and what she is? By Jove, 'tis
the face&mdash;the figure of an angel! egad, they're <i>somebody</i>;
I'll look at their panels!"</p>

<p>"I know who it is," said Titmouse, rather faintly;
"I'll tell you by-and-by."</p>

<p>"Now, <i>now</i>! my dear fellow. Our divinity is vanishing,"
whispered Mr. Yahoo, eagerly, as Miss Aubrey, having
slipped something into the beggar's hand, stepped
into the carriage. As soon as her brother had entered,
the door was closed, and they drove off.</p>

<p>"Who's that, Mr. Titmouse?" inquired Miss Quirk,
with a little eagerness, observing&mdash;women are very quick
in detecting such matters&mdash;that both Gammon and Titmouse
looked rather embarrassed.</p>

<p>"It's the&mdash;the Aubreys," replied Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Eh! By Jove!&mdash;is it?" quickly inquired old Quirk,
putting his head out of the window; "how very odd, to
meet the old birds? Egad! their nest must be yet warm&mdash;ha!
ha!"</p>

<p>"What! dear papa, are those the people you've turned
out? Gracious! I thought I heard some one say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Miss Aubrey was pretty! La! I'm sure <i>I</i> thought&mdash;now
what do <i>you</i> think, Mr. Titmouse?" she added, turning
abruptly and looking keenly at him.</p>

<p>"Oh! 'pon my life, I&mdash;I&mdash;see nothing at all in her&mdash;devilish
plain, I should say&mdash;infernally pale, and all that!"</p>

<p>They were soon on their way again. Titmouse quickly
recovered his equanimity, but Gammon continued silent
and thoughtful for many&mdash;many miles; and the reader
would not be surprised at it, if he knew as well as
I do the thoughts which the unexpected sight of that
travelling-carriage of Mr. Aubrey had suggested to Mr.
Gammon.</p>

<p>As they approached the scene of triumph and rejoicing,
and ascertained that they were within about a mile of the
peaceful little village of Yatton, the travellers began to
look out for indications of the kind which Mr. Gammon
had mentioned to Titmouse, viz. a band and procession,
and an attendant crowd. But however careful and extensive
might have been the arrangements of those to
whom that matter had been intrusted, they were likely
to be sadly interfered with by a circumstance which, happening
just then, might, to a weaker and more superstitious
mind than that of Mr. Titmouse, have looked a little
ominous&mdash;namely, the occurrence of a tremendous thunder-storm.
It was then about five o'clock in the afternoon.
The whole day had been overcast, and the sky threatening;
and just as the two carriages came to that turning in the
road which gave them the first glimpse of the Hall&mdash;only,
however, the tops of the great antique brick chimneys,
which were visible above the surrounding trees&mdash;a
fearful, long-continued flash of lightning burst from the
angry heavens, followed, after an interval of but a second
or two, by a peal of thunder which sounded as if a park
of artillery was being repeatedly discharged immediately
overhead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mind your horses' heads, boys," called out Mr. Gammon;
"keep a tight rein."</p>

<p>Miss Quirk was dreadfully alarmed, and clung to her
father; Titmouse also seemed disconcerted, and looked
to Gammon, who was perfectly calm, though his face was
not free from anxiety. The ghastly glare of the lightning
was again around them&mdash;all involuntarily hid their
faces in their hands&mdash;and again rattled the thunder in a
peal lasting more than half a minute, and seeming to be
in frightful contiguity, as it were only a few yards above
their heads. Down, then, came the long-suspended rain,
pouring like a deluge, and so it continued, with frequent
returns of the thunder and lightning, for nearly a quarter
of an hour. The last turning brought them within sight
of the village, and also of some fifty or sixty persons crowding
under the hedges, on each side&mdash;these were the triumphant
procession; musicians, flagmen, footmen, horsemen,
all dripping with wet, and constituting surely a spectacle
piteous to behold. Out, however, they all turned, true
to their orders, as soon as they saw the carriages, which
immediately slackened their speed&mdash;the rain also somewhat
abating. The flagman tried desperately to unroll a
wet banner, of considerable size, with the words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div align="center"> "<span class="smcap">Welcome to Yatton!</span>" </div>

</blockquote>

<p>in gilded letters; while the band (consisting of a man with
a big drum, another with a serpent, a third with a trumpet,
a fourth with a bassoon, two with clarionets, and a
boy with a fife) struck up&mdash;"<i>See the conquering hero
comes!</i>" They puffed and blew lustily; bang! bang!
bang! went the drum; but the rain, the thunder, and
the lightning woefully interfered with their harmony.
'Twould have made your heart ache to see the wet
flag clinging obstinately to the pole, in spite of all the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
efforts of its burly bearer! But now for the procession&mdash;first,
on horseback, was Barnabas Bloodsuck, (senior,) Esq.;
beside him rode his son, Barnabas Bloodsuck, (junior,)
Esq.; then came the Reverend Gideon Fleshpot, solemn
simpleton, the vicar of Grilston, the only Radical clergyman
in that part of the country; beside him, the Reverend
Smirk Mudflint, a flippant, bitter, little Unitarian
parson, a great crony of Mr. Fleshpot, and his surname
singularly enough exactly designating the qualities of his
brain and heart. Next to these, alone in his one-horse
chaise, (looking like a pill-box drawn by a leech,) came
the little fat Whig apothecary, Gargle Glister, Esq. Following
him came, also in a gig, Going Gone, Esq., the
auctioneer&mdash;the main prop of the Liberal side, being a
most eloquent speaker&mdash;and Mr. Hic Hæc Hoc, a learned
schoolmaster, who undertook to teach the rudiments of
Latin, viz. the Latin grammar up as far as the irregular
verbs. Then there were Mr. Centipede, the editor,
and Mr. Woodhouse, the publisher and proprietor of the
"<span class="smcap">Yorkshire Stingo</span>," for which, also, Mr. Mudflint wrote
a great deal. These, and about a dozen others, the flower
of the "party" thereabouts, disdainful of the inclement
weather, bent on displaying their attachment to the new
owner of Yatton, and solacing each his patient inner man
with anticipation of the jolly cheer awaiting him at the
Hall, formed the principal part of the procession; the
rest consisting of rather a miscellaneous assortment of
scot-and-lot and potwalloper-looking people, all very wet
and hungry, and very frequently casting looks of devout
expectation towards the Hall. Scarcely a villager of Yatton
was to be seen stirring; nor did any of the tenants
of the estate join in the procession; even had they not
felt far otherwise disposed, they had luckily a complete
excuse for their non-appearance in the deplorable state of
the weather. Sometimes the band played; then a peal
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of thunder came; then a cry of "hurra! Titmouse forever!
hurra!" then the band, and then the thunder, and
rain! rain! rain! Thus they got to the park gates, where
they paused, the half-drowned men and boys shouting,
"Titmouse forever! hurra&mdash;a&mdash;a!" Mr. Titmouse bobbing
about, now at one window, then at the other, with
his hat off, in the most gracious manner. Really it seemed
almost as if the elements were indicating the displeasure
of heaven at Mr. Titmouse's assumption of Yatton; for
just as he was passing under the old gateway, out flashed
the lightning more vividly than it had yet appeared, and
the thunder bellowed and reverberated among the woods
as though it would never have ceased. The music and
shouting now ended suddenly; carriages, horsemen, pedestrians,
quickened their pace in silence, as if anxious to
get out of the storm; the horses now and then plunging
and rearing violently. Titmouse was terribly frightened,
in spite of his desperate efforts to appear unconcerned.
He was as pale as death, and looked anxiously at Gammon,
as if hoping to derive courage from the sight of his
rigid countenance. Miss Quirk trembled violently, and
several times uttered a faint scream: but her father, old
Mr. Quirk, did not seem to care a pinch of snuff about
the whole matter; he rubbed his hands together cheerily,
chucked his daughter under the chin, rallied Titmouse,
and now and then nudged and jeered Gammon, who seemed
disposed to be serious and silent. Having drawn up opposite
the Hall door, it was opened by Mr. Griffiths, with
a saddened, but still respectful look and manner; and in
the same way might be characterized some six or seven
servants standing behind him, in readiness to receive the
new-comers. The half-drowned musicians tried to strike up
"Rule Britannia," as the hero of the day, Mr. Titmouse,
descended from his carriage, Mr. Griffiths holding an umbrella
for him, and bounded out of the rain with a hop,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
step, and jump into the Hall, where the first words he
was heard to utter, were&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a devilish rum old place!"</p>

<p>"God bless you! God bless you! God bless you, Titmouse!"
exclaimed old Mr. Quirk, grasping him by the
hand as soon as he had entered. Titmouse shook hands
with Miss Quirk, who immediately followed a female servant
to an apartment, being exceedingly nervous and
agitated. Gammon seemed a little out of spirits; and
said simply, "You know, Mr. Titmouse, how fervently <i>I</i>
congratulate you."</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear boy, Tit, do, for Heaven's sake, if you
want the thunder and lightning to cease, order those
wretched devils off&mdash;send them anywhere, but do stop
their cursed noise, my dear boy!" exclaimed Mr. Yahoo,
as soon as he had entered, putting his fingers to his ears.</p>

<p>"Mr. what's-your-name," said Titmouse, addressing Mr.
Griffiths, "I'll trouble you to order off those fellows and
their infernal noise. Demme! there's a precious row making
up above, and surely <i>one at a time</i> will do&mdash;demme!"</p>

<p>"Ah, ha, capital joke, by Jove! capital!" said Mr.
Fitz-Snooks, arranging his shirt-collar.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;Titmouse&mdash;by Jupiter!" said Mr. Yahoo, as,
twirling his fingers about in his long black hair, of which
he seemed very proud, he glanced about the Hall, "this
a'n't so much amiss! Do you know, my dear boy, I rather
like it; it's substantial, antique, and so forth!"</p>

<p>"Who are those dem ugly old fellows up there?" presently
exclaimed Titmouse, as, with his glass stuck into
his right eye, and his hands into his coat-pockets, he stood
staring at the old-fashioned pictures.</p>

<p>"Some of them, sir," replied Mr. Griffiths, with an irrepressible
sigh, "are ancestors of the Dreddlingtons, others
of the Aubrey families. They are very old, sir," continued
Mr. Griffiths, "and are much admired, and Mr.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Aubrey desired me to say, that if you should be disposed
to part"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh confound him, he may have 'em all, if he'll pay
for 'em, if that's what he wants: I shall soon send them
packing off!" Mr. Griffiths bowed, and very nearly shed
a tear. By this time the Hall was crowded with the gentlemen
who had formed part of the procession, and who
came bowing and scraping to the new lord of Yatton,
congratulating him, and wishing him health and happiness.
As soon as he could disengage himself from their
flattering but somewhat troublesome civilities, Tweedle
(his valet) came and whispered, "Will you dress, sir?
All is ready," and Titmouse followed him to the dressing-room
which had formerly been young Mrs. Aubrey's.
'Twas the first time that Titmouse had ever experienced
the attentions of a valet; and he was quite nonplussed at
the multitudinousness and elegance of the arrangements
around him. Such quantities of clothes of all sorts&mdash;dressing-implements,
curling-irons, combs, brushes, razors,
a splendid dressing-case, scents in profusion, oils, bear's-grease,
four or five different sorts of soaps, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.;
all this gave Titmouse a far livelier idea of his altered
circumstances, of his having really become a <small>GENTLEMAN</small>,
than anything which he had up to that moment experienced.
He thought his valet one of the cleverest and
most obliging men in the world, only somewhat oppressive
with his attentions; and at length Mr. Titmouse said
he preferred <i>this</i> time, dressing alone, and so dismissed
his obsequious attendant; whom, however, he was soon
obliged to summon to his assistance after all, not knowing
the proper uses of several implements about him. Having
completed his toilet, he descended into the drawing-room;
which, as well as the dining-room, was ready prepared
for the banquet, covers being laid for forty or fifty, and
good substantial fare provided for at least as many more,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
in the servants' hall, where operations had already commenced.
On entering the drawing-room, his appearance
seemed to produce a great sensation; and after a momentary
and embarrassing pause, the only county gentleman
who was present, advanced and introduced himself, his
wife and daughter. This was Harkaway Rotgut Wildfire,
Baronet, a tall and somewhat corpulent man of
about fifty, very choleric and overbearing; his countenance
showing the hard life he had led, his nose being
red, and his forehead and mouth beset with pimples.
He had been a bitter political opponent of Mr. Aubrey,
and once a member for the county; but had so crippled
his resources by hunting and horse-racing, as to compel
the sacrifice of their town amusements; viz. his seat in
the House of Commons, and Lady Wildfire's box at the
opera. This had soured both of them not a little, and
they had completely sunk out of the county circle, in
which they had once been sufficiently conspicuous. Sir
Harkaway had an eye to the borough of Yatton on the
happening of the next election, as soon as he had obtained
an inkling that the new proprietor of Yatton was a very
weak young man; and hence his patronizing presence at
Yatton, in consequence of the invitation respectfully conveyed
to him in Mr. Titmouse's name, through Messrs.
Bloodsuck and Son. Besides Lady Wildfire and her daughter,
both of whom had inquired with a sort of haughty curiosity
about the lady who had accompanied Mr. Titmouse
from town&mdash;a point which had been at length cleared up
to their satisfaction&mdash;there were about a dozen ladies,
the wives of the gentlemen who had borne so distinguished
a part in the triumphal procession. They certainly looked
rather a queer set; and none of them dared to speak either
to Lady Wildfire or her daughter till spoken to by them.
Never had old Yatton beheld within its walls so motley
a group; and had the Aubreys continued there, hospitable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
as they were, accessible and charitable as they were,
I leave the reader to guess whether such creatures ever
<i>would</i> have found their way thither. By such guests, however,
were the two principal tables crowded on this joyous
occasion, and about half-past six o'clock the feast commenced,
and a feast it certainly was, both elegant and
substantial, nothing having been spared that money could
procure. Mr. Aubrey had a fine cellar of wines at Yatton,
which, owing to some strange misunderstanding, had been
sold by private contract, not among his own friends in
the neighborhood, as Mr. Aubrey had intended, and imagined
that he had directed, but to Mr. Titmouse. Choice,
indeed, were these wines, and supplied on the present occasion
in wanton profusion. Champagne, Burgundy, and
claret, flowed like water, and the rich old port, sherry,
and madeira in like manner;&mdash;these last, however, not
being confined to the two principal rooms, but finding their
way into the servants' hall, where they there drank without
stint. Merriment echoed uproariously from all parts
of the old Hall, and Mr. Titmouse was universally declared
to be a very fine fellow, and likely to become by far the
most popular man in the county. The Reverend Mr. Fleshpot
said grace, and the Reverend Mr. Mudflint returned
thanks; and shortly afterwards Sir Harkaway arose, and,
his eye fixed firmly on the adjoining borough, and also
on the jolly table which promised to be ever open to him
at Yatton, he proposed the health of the distinguished
proprietor of Yatton, in a very flattering and energetic
speech. The toast was received with the utmost enthusiasm;
the gentlemen shouted and jingled their glasses
on the table, while the ladies waved their handkerchiefs;
indeed the scene was one of such overpowering excitement,
that Miss Quirk burst into tears, overcome by her emotions;
her papa winking very hard to those about him,
and using every exertion in his power to point the attention
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of those present to the probability that a very
near and tender relationship was about to exist between
that young lady and Mr. Titmouse. Mr. Gammon, who
sat next to Titmouse, assured him that it was absolutely
necessary for him to make a speech to the company, in
acknowledgment of the compliment which had just been
paid him.</p>

<p>"I shall put my foot into it&mdash;by jingo I shall! You
must help me!" he whispered to Mr. Gammon, in an
agony of trepidation and a mist of confusion, as he rose
from his chair, being welcomed in the most enthusiastic
manner, by applause of every kind, lasting for several
minutes. At length, when the noise had subsided into a
fearful silence, he stammered out, prompted incessantly
by Mr. Gammon, something exceedingly like the following,
if, indeed, he did not use these very words.</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;<i>Sir</i> Hark&mdash;away, and gentlemen&mdash;gentlemen
and ladies, am most uncommon,
monstrous&mdash;particular happy to&mdash;to&mdash;(eh? <i>what</i> d'ye
say, Mr. Gammon?) see you all here&mdash;at this place&mdash;here&mdash;at
Yatton.&mdash;(<i>Applause.</i>) Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;I
say&mdash;hem!&mdash;unaccustomed as&mdash;(<i>much applause</i>,
during which Titmouse stooped and whispered to
Gammon&mdash;"Curse me if I can catch a word you say!")
Happy and proud to see you all here&mdash;at Yatton&mdash;homes
of my ancestry&mdash;known to you all&mdash;centuries.
Enjoyed yourselves, I hope&mdash;(<i>great applause</i>)&mdash;and hope
you'll often come and do the same&mdash;(<i>still greater applause.</i>)
Particular glad to see the ladies&mdash;(<i>applause</i>)&mdash;often
heard of the beauties of Yatton&mdash;never believed
it&mdash;no&mdash;beg pardon, mean I now see them&mdash;(<i>applause.</i>)
Am fond of horses&mdash;(<i>applause</i>)&mdash;racing, hunting, and
all that. (Here Sir Harkaway, extending his hand,
publicly shook that of the eloquent speaker.) Sorry to
turn out the&mdash;the&mdash;old bird&mdash;but&mdash;nest not <i>his</i>&mdash;mine
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
all the while&mdash;(<i>sensation</i>)&mdash;bear him no ill-will&mdash;(<i>applause.</i>)
Political principles&mdash;(<i>profound silence.</i>) Liberal
principles&mdash;(<i>loud applause</i>)&mdash;rights of the people&mdash;religious
liberty and all that&mdash;(<i>vociferous applause</i>)&mdash;found
at my post in the hour of danger&mdash;enemy stole a
march on me&mdash;(<i>great laughter and applause.</i>)  Won't
detain you&mdash;ladies and gentlemen&mdash;drink your good
healths, and many happy returns of the day." Down sat
Mr. Titmouse, exhausted by his maiden speech; and quite
overpowered, moreover, by the extraordinary applause
with which he was greeted at its conclusion. In due
course, many other toasts were drunk; among them were&mdash;"<i>Lady
Wildfire and the married ladies.</i>" "<i>Miss Wildfire
and the single ladies.</i>" "<i>Sir Harkaway Rotgut Wildfire.</i>"
"<i>Religious Liberty</i>," (to which Mr. Mudflint responded
in a very eloquent speech.) "<i>The Liberty of the
Press;</i>" "<i>Messrs Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, the enterprising,
skilful, and learned professional advisers of Mr. Titmouse.</i>"
Dancing was now loudly called for; and the hall
was speedily prepared for it. By this time, however, it
was past eleven o'clock; the free potations of all the gentlemen,
and indeed (to be candid) of more than one of the
ladies, were beginning to <i>tell</i>, and the noise and confusion
were very great. Fierce confused sounds issued from the
servants' hall, where it proved that a great fight was going
on between Pumpkin the gardener, and a man who insisted
on shouting "Titmouse forever&mdash;down with Aubrey!"
Pumpkin, I am not sorry to say, had much the
best of it, and beat his opponent, after a severe encounter,
into silence and submission. Then there were songs sung
in all the rooms at once&mdash;speeches made, half-a-dozen at
the same time; in short, never before had such doings
been witnessed, or such uproar heard, within the decorous,
dignified, and venerable precincts of Yatton. Scenes
ensued which really baffle description. Mr. Titmouse, of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
course, drank prodigiously, although Mr. Gammon never
left his side, and checked him fifty times when he was
about to fill his glass. The excitement thus produced by
wine will, I trust, in some measure mitigate the reader's
indignation at hearing of a little incident which occurred,
in which Titmouse was concerned, and which, about half past
three or four o'clock in the morning, served to bring
that brilliant entertainment to a somewhat abrupt and
rather unpleasant termination. Scarcely knowing where
he was, or what he was about, I am sorry to say, that
while standing, as well as he could, beside Miss Wildfire,
to dance for the fifth time with her&mdash;a plump, fair-faced,
good-natured girl of about nineteen or twenty&mdash;he suddenly
threw his arms around her, and imprinted half-a-dozen
kisses on her forehead, lips, cheek, and neck, before
she could recover from the confusion into which this monstrous
outrage had thrown her. Her faint shriek reached
her father's ears, while he was, in a distant part of the
room, persecuting Miss Quirk with drunken and profligate
impertinence. Hastily approaching the quarter whence
his daughter's voice had issued, he beheld her just extricated
from the insolent embrace of the half-unconscious
Titmouse, and greatly agitated. With flaming eye and
outstretched arm, he approached his unfortunate little
host, and seizing hold of his right ear, almost wrung it
out of his head, Titmouse actually yelling with the pain
which he experienced. Still retaining his hold, uttering
the while most fearful imprecations&mdash;Sir Harkaway gave
him three violent kicks upon the seat of honor, the last
of them sending him spinning into the arms of old Mr.
Quirk, who was hurrying up to his relief, and who fell
flat on the floor with the violent concussion. Then Miss
Quirk rushed forward and screamed; a scene of dreadful
confusion ensued; and at length the infuriated and
half-drunken baronet, forced away by his wife and his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
daughter, aided by several of the company, quitted the
Hall, and got into his carriage, uttering fearful threats
and curses all the way home; without once adverting to
the circumstance, of which also Lady Wildfire and her
daughter were not aware, that he had been himself engaged
in perpetrating nearly the same sort of misconduct
which he had so severely and justly punished in poor
Titmouse. As for Mr. Yahoo and Mr. Fitz-Snooks, they
had been in quest of similar sport the whole night; and
had each of them, in pursuing their adventures in the
servants' hall, very narrowly escaped much more serious
indignities and injuries than had fallen to the lot of the
hospitable owner of the mansion.</p>

<p>About half-past four o'clock, the sun was shining in
cloudless splendor, the air cleared, and all nature seeming
freshened after the storm of the preceding day; but
what a scene was presented at Yatton! Two or three
persons, one with his hat off, asleep; another grasping a
half-empty bottle; and a third in a state of desperate indisposition,
were to be seen, at considerable distances from
each other, by the side of the carriage-road leading down
to the park gates. Four or five horses, ready saddled and
bridled, but neglected, and apparently forgotten by both
servants and masters, were wandering about the fine green
old court opposite the Hall door, eating the grass, and
crushing with their hoofs the beautiful beds of flowers and
shrubs which surrounded it. Mr. Glister's gig had got
its wheels entangled with the old sundial&mdash;having been
drawn thither by the horse, which had been put into it at
least two hours before; opposite the Hall door stood the
post-chaise which had brought Mr. and Mrs. Mudflint and
their daughter. The latter two were sitting in it, one
asleep&mdash;the other, Mrs. Mudflint, anxiously on the look-out
for her husband, from time to time calling to him,
but in vain; for about half an hour before, he had quitted
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the room where he, Mr. Fleshpot, Mr. Going Gone, and
Mr. Centipede had been playing a rubber at whist, till all
of them had nearly fallen asleep with their cards in their
hands, and made his way to the stables; where, not finding
his chaise in the yard, or his horses in the stalls, he
supposed his wife and daughter had gone home, whither
he followed them by the footpath leading through the
fields which stretched along the high-road to Grilston;
and along which said fields he was, at that moment, staggering,
hiccuping, not clearly understanding where he
was, nor where he had last seen his wife and daughter.
Candles and lamps were still burning and glimmering in
some of the rooms; and in the servants' hall there were
some dozen or so of the lower kind of guests, who, having
awakened from a deep sleep, were calling for more ale, or
wine, or whatever else they could get. Some of the old
family servants had fled hours before from scenes of such
unwanted riot, to their bedrooms, and, having locked and
barricaded the doors, had gone to sleep. Mr. Griffiths sat
in an old armchair in the library, the picture of misery;
he had been repeatedly abused and insulted during the
night, and had gone thither, unable to bear the sight of
the disgusting revelry that was going forward. In short,
at every point that caught the eye, were visible the evidences
of the villanous debauchery which had prevailed
for the last seven hours; and which, under the Titmouse
dynasty, was likely to prevail at all times thereafter. As
for Mr. Titmouse, half stunned with the treatment which
he had experienced at the hands of Sir Harkaway, he had
been carried to bed&mdash;where his excessive, miscellaneous,
and long-continued potations aggravating the effect of the
serious injuries which he had sustained, he lay sprawling,
half undressed, in a truly deplorable condition. Mr.
Glister, who had been summoned to his bedside upwards
of an hour before, sat now nodding in his chair beside his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
patient; and pretty nearly in a state of similar exhaustion
were his valet and the housekeeper, who had, from time
to time, wiped her eyes and sobbed aloud when thinking
of past times, and the horrid change which had come over
old Yatton. Mr. Yahoo, Mr. Fitz-Snooks, Mr. Snap, Mr.
Quirk, and Miss Quirk, (the last having retired to her bedroom
in the utmost terror, at the time of Titmouse's mischance,)
were in their respective chambers, all of them
probably asleep. Poor Hector, chained to his kennel,
having barked himself hoarse for several hours, lay fast
asleep, no one having attended to him, or given him anything
to eat since Mr. Titmouse's arrival. Gammon had
retired from the scene, in disgust and alarm, to his bedroom,
some three hours before; but unable to sleep&mdash;not,
however, with excess of wine, for he had drunk very
little&mdash;had arisen about four o'clock, and was at that
moment wandering slowly, with folded arms and downcast
countenance, up and down the fine avenue of elm-trees,
where, it may be recollected, Mr. Aubrey had spent a portion
of the last evening of his stay at Yatton.</p>

<p>Such is <i>my</i> account of that memorable entertainment&mdash;and
as fair an account as I know how to give of the
matter; but it is curious to observe how very differently
the same thing will strike different people. As soon as
the grateful Mr. Centipede had recovered from the excitement
occasioned by the part which he had borne in
the splendid festival, he set to work, with the pen of a
ready writer, and in the next number of the "<span class="smcap">Yorkshire
Stingo</span>," there appeared the following interesting account
of the</p>

<blockquote>

<div align="center">"<span class="smcap">Festivities</span> <i>at</i> <span class="smcap">Yatton Hall</span>, <i>on the occasion of</i> <small>POSSESSION</small>
<i>being taken by</i> <span class="smcap">Tittlebat Titmouse, Esquire</span>.</div>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Yesterday this interesting event came off with signal <i>éclat</i>.
Notwithstanding the very unfavorable state of the weather,
about five o'clock in the evening an imposing cavalcade, comprising
many of the leading gentry and yeomanry of this part
of the county, on foot and on horseback, preceded by an admirable
band, and a large and splendid banner, bearing the
inscription&mdash;'<i>Welcome to Yatton</i>,' went out to meet the above
distinguished gentleman, whose <i>cortège</i>, in two carriages, made
its appearance in the village about half-past five. The band
immediately struck up 'See the Conquering Hero comes!'
which inspiriting air, however, was nearly drowned in the
shout which welcomed the new proprietor of the noble estate
of Yatton. His carriage was of the most tasteful, splendid,
and unique description, and attracted universal admiration.
Mr. Titmouse repeatedly bowed through the carriage-windows,
in graceful acknowledgment of the cordial welcome and congratulations
with which he was received. He was dressed in
a light blue surtout, with velvet collar, full black stock, and a
rich velvet waistcoat of plaid pattern. His countenance is
handsome and expressive, his eye penetrating, and his brow
strongly indicative of thought. He appears to be little more
than twenty-five years old; so that he has before him the prospect
of a long and brilliant career of happiness and public
usefulness. Tables were spread in all the chief apartments,
groaning beneath the most costly viands. All the luxuries of
the season were there; and the wines (which we believe were
those of Mr. Aubrey) were of the first description. Grace was
said by the exemplary vicar of Grilston, the Rev. Mr. Fleshpot;
and the Rev. Mr. Mudflint returned thanks. Sir Harkaway
Rotgut Wildfire (whose amiable lady and accomplished
daughter were present) proposed the health of Mr. Titmouse
in a brief, but manly and cordial address; and the manner in
which Mr. Titmouse acknowledged the toast, which was drunk
with the greatest possible enthusiasm&mdash;the simplicity, point,
and fervor which characterized every word he uttered&mdash;were
such as to excite lively emotion in all who heard it, and warrant
the highest expectations of his success in Parliament.
Nothing could be more touching than his brief allusions to
the sufferings and privations which he had undergone&mdash;nothing
more delicate and forbearing than the feeling which pervaded
his momentary allusion to the late occupant of Yatton.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
When, however, he distinctly avowed his political principles
as those of a dauntless champion of civil and religious liberty
among all classes of his Majesty's subjects&mdash;the applause was
long and enthusiastic. After dinner, the great hall was cleared
for dancing, which was opened by Mr. Titmouse and Miss
Wildfire; Lady Wildfire being led out by the Honorable [!]
Mr. Yahoo, an intimate friend of Mr. Titmouse. We should
not omit to mention that Miss Quirk (the only daughter of
Caleb Quirk, Esq., the head of the distinguished firm of Quirk,
Gammon, and Snap, of London, to whose untiring and most
able exertions is owing the happy change which has taken
place in the ownership of the Yatton property) accompanied
her father, at the earnest request of Mr. Titmouse, who danced
several sets with her; and it is whispered&mdash;but we will not
anticipate family arrangements. Sir [!] Algernon Fitz-Snooks,
a distinguished fashionable, also accompanied Mr. Titmouse,
and entered with great spirit into all the gayeties of the evening.
The 'light fantastic toe' was kept 'tripping' till a late,
or rather very early hour in the morning&mdash;when the old
Hall was once more (for a time) surrendered to the repose
and solitude from which it has been so suddenly and joyously
aroused."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[In another part of the paper was contained an insulting
paragraph, charging Mr. Aubrey with being a party
to the "flagrant and iniquitous job," by which Sir Percival
Pickering had been returned for the borough; and
intimating pretty distinctly, that Mr. Aubrey had not
gone without "<i>a consideration</i>" for his share in the nefarious
transaction.]</p>

<p>A somewhat different account of the affair appeared in
the "<span class="smcap">York True Blue</span>" of the same day.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Yatton Hall</span>.&mdash;We have received one or two accounts
of the orgies of which this venerable mansion was yesterday
the scene, on occasion of Mr. Titmouse taking possession. We
shall not give publicity to the details which have been furnished
us&mdash;hoping that the youth and inexperience of the new
owner of Yatton (all allowance, also, being made for the very
natural excitement of such an occasion) will be deemed a palliative
in some measure of the conduct then exhibited.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>One fact, however, we may mention, that a very serious <i>fracas</i> arose
between Mr. Titmouse and a certain well-known sporting baronet,
which is expected to give employment to the gentlemen of
the long robe at the ensuing assizes. Nor can we resist adverting
to a circumstance, which our readers will, we trust, credit,
on being assured that we witnessed it with our own eyes&mdash;that
Mr. Titmouse positively travelled in the cast-off state carriage
of the Lord Mayor of London!!!! Nothing, by the way,
could be more absurd and contemptible than the attempt at a
'Procession' which was got up&mdash;of which our accounts are
ludicrous in the extreme. Will our readers believe it, that
the chief personages figuring on the occasion, were the editor
and publisher of a certain low Radical print&mdash;which will no
doubt, this day, favor its readers with a flaming description of
this 'memorable affair!'"</p>

</blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Titmouse, assisted by his attentive valet, made a desperate
attempt to get up, and present himself the next
day at dinner. Aided by a glass of pretty strong brandy
and water, he at length got through the fatiguing duties
of the toilet, and entered the drawing-room, where his
travelling companions were awaiting his arrival&mdash;dinner
being momentarily expected to be announced. He was
deadly pale; his knees trembled; his temples throbbed;
his eyes could not bear the light; and everything seemed
in undulating motion around him, as he sank in silent
exhaustion on the sofa. After a few minutes' continuance,
he was compelled to leave the room, leaning on
Gammon's arm, who conducted him to his chamber, and
left him in charge of his valet, who got him again into
bed, and there he lay, enduring much agony, (Dr. Goddart
being sent for,) while his friends were enjoying themselves
at dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Snap had set off the ensuing day for town, by the first
coach, pursuant to the arrangements already spoken of;
but I think that old Mr. Quirk would have made up his
mind to continue at Yatton until something definite had
been done by Titmouse, in two matters which absorbed
all the thoughts of the old gentleman&mdash;his daughter and
the <i>Ten Thousand Pounds</i> bond. Miss Quirk, however,
intense as was her anxiety to become the affianced bride
of Titmouse, and as such the mistress of the delightful
domain where at present she dwelt only as a guest, and
in a very embarrassing position&mdash;was not so blind to all
perception of womanly delicacy as to prolong her stay;
and at length prevailed upon her father to take their
departure on the day but one after that on which they
had arrived. Mr. Quirk was perfectly miserable. He
vehemently distrusted Titmouse&mdash;and feared and detested
Gammon. As for the former gentleman, he had
not made any definite advances whatever towards Miss
Quirk, nor afforded to any one the slightest evidence of
a promise of marriage, either express or implied. He
chattered to Miss Quirk an infinite deal of vulgar absurdity&mdash;but
that was all, in spite of the innumerable
opportunities afforded him by the lady and her anxious
parent. Was Titmouse acting under the secret advice of
that deceitful devil Gammon?&mdash;thought Mr. Quirk, in
an ecstasy of perplexity and apprehension. Then as to
the other matter&mdash;but there Gammon had almost as
deep a stake, in proportion, as Quirk himself. On the
morning of his departure, he and Gammon had a very
long interview, in which they several times came to high
words; but in the end Gammon vanquished his opponent
as usual; allayed all his apprehensions; and accounted
for all Titmouse's conduct in the most natural way in the
world. "Look at his position just now," quoth Gammon&mdash;"the
excitement, the novelty, the bewilderment, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
indisposition he is experiencing: surely, surely <i>this</i> is not
a moment to bring him to book!" In short, Gammon at
length brought Quirk, who had received the first intimation
of the matter with a sudden <i>grunt</i> of surprise and
anger, to acknowledge the propriety of Gammon's remaining
behind, to protect Titmouse from the designing Yahoo
that had got hold of him; and solemnly pledged himself,
as in the sight of Heaven, to use his utmost efforts to
bring about, as speedily as possible, the two grand objects
of Mr. Quirk's wishes. With this the old gentleman
was fain to be satisfied; but entered the chaise which
was to convey Miss Quirk and himself to Grilston, with
as rueful a countenance as he had ever exhibited in his
life. Mr. Titmouse was sufficiently recovered to be present
at the departure of Miss Quirk, who regarded his
interesting and languid looks with an eye of melting
sympathy and affection. With half a smile and half a
tear, she slipped into his hand, as he led her to the chaise,
a little sprig of heart's ease, which he at once stuck into
the button-hole of his coat.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul&mdash;must you go? Devilish sorry you
can't stay to have seen some fun!&mdash;The old gent" (meaning
her father) "don't quite seem to like it&mdash;he, he!" said
he, in a low tone; then he handed her into the chaise, she
dropping her veil to conceal the starting tear of mingled
disappointment, and desire, and disgust, and they drove
off, Titmouse kissing his hand to her as he stood upon
the steps; and, as soon as they were out of sight, he
exchanged a very significant smile with Mr. Gammon.</p>

<p>The next day, Titmouse rose about ten o'clock, almost
entirely recovered from his indisposition. Accompanied
by Mr. Yahoo and Mr. Fitz-Snooks, with whom he was
conversing as to the course he should take with reference
to Sir Harkaway&mdash;whom, however, they advised him to
treat with silent contempt, as he, Titmouse, was clearly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
in the wrong&mdash;he took a stroll about noon, down the
path leading to the park gates. They all three had
cigars in their mouths, Titmouse walking between them,
as odious-looking a little puppy, sure, as man ever saw&mdash;puffing
out his smoke slowly, and with half-closed eye,
his right hand stuck into his coat-pocket, and resting on
his hip. These three figures&mdash;Heaven save the mark!&mdash;were
the new lord of Yatton and his select friends!</p>

<p>"By jingo, surely here comes a parson," quoth Titmouse;
"what the devil can he want here?"&mdash;'Twas
Dr. Tatham, who slowly approached them, dressed in his
Sunday suit, and leaning on his old-fashioned walking-stick,
given him many, many years ago by the deceased
Mrs. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Let's have some sport," said Fitz-Snooks.</p>

<p>"We must look devilish serious&mdash;no grinning till the
proper time," said Yahoo.</p>

<p>"Hallo&mdash;you sir!" commenced Titmouse, "who are
you?" Dr. Tatham took off his hat, bowed, and was
passing on.</p>

<p>"<i>Devilish</i> cool, upon&mdash;my&mdash;soul&mdash;sir?" said Titmouse,
stopping, and staring impudently at the worthy
little doctor, who seemed taken quite by surprise.</p>

<p>"My worthy old gentleman," said Yahoo, with mock
respect, "are you aware who it was that asked you a
question?"</p>

<p>"I am not, sir," replied Dr. Tatham, quietly but
resolutely.</p>

<p>"My name is Tittlebat Titmouse, at your service&mdash;and
you are now in my grounds," said Titmouse, approaching
him with an impudent air.</p>

<p>"Am I really addressed by Mr. Titmouse?" inquired
Dr. Tatham, somewhat incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why, 'pon my life, I <i>think</i> so, unless I'm changed
lately; and by Jove, sir&mdash;<i>now</i>, who are you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am Dr. Tatham, sir, the vicar of Yatton: I <i>had</i>
intended calling at the Hall, as a matter of courtesy; but
I fear I am intruding"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Devil a bit&mdash;no, 'pon honor, no! you're a very
good old fellow, I don't doubt!&mdash;Pray&mdash;a&mdash;is that
little church outside, yours?"</p>

<p>"It is, sir," replied Dr. Tatham, seriously and sternly;
his manner completely abashing the presumptuous little
coxcomb who addressed him.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;'pon my soul, happy to see
you, sir&mdash;you'll find something to eat in the Hall, I
dare say"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you preach in that same little church of yours
next Sunday?" inquired Mr. Yahoo, whose gross countenance
had filled Dr. Tatham with unspeakable aversion.</p>

<p>"I preach there <i>every</i> Sunday, sir, twice," he replied
gravely and distantly.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," lisped Fitz-Snooks, "the prayers are so&mdash;so&mdash;<i>devilish</i>
long and tiresome&mdash;if you could&mdash;eh?&mdash;shorten
'em a little?"&mdash;</p>

<p>Dr. Tatham slowly turned away from them, and, disregarding
their calls to him, though their tone of voice was
greatly altered, walked back again towards the gate, and
quitted the park for the first time in his life, with feelings
of mortal repugnance. On reaching his little study, he
sat down in his old armchair, and fell into a sad revery,
which lasted more than an hour; and then he rose, and
went to see the old blind stag-hound fed&mdash;and looked
at it, licking his hands, with feelings of unusual tenderness;
and the doctor shed a tear or two as he patted its
smooth gray old head.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, Mr. Titmouse, at Mr. Gammon's
instance, had fixed to go over the estate, accompanied by
that gentleman, and by Mr. Waters and Dickons, to give
all the information required of them, and point out the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
position and extent of the property. To an eye capable
of appreciating it, in what admirable order was everything!
but Titmouse quickly tired of it, and when about
a mile from the Hall, discovered that he had left his
cigar-box behind him; at which he expressed infinite concern,
and, greatly to the annoyance of Gammon, and the
contempt of his two bailiffs, insisted on returning home;
so they re-entered the park. How beautiful it was! Its
gently undulating surface, smooth as if overspread with
green velvet; trees great and small, single and in clumps,
standing in positions so picturesque and commanding;
the broad, babbling, clear trout-stream winding through
every part of the park, with here and there a mimic fall,
seen faintly flashing and glistening in the distance; herds
of deer suddenly startled amid their green pastures and
silent shades, and moving off with graceful ease and rapidity;
here and there a rustic bridge over the stream;
here an old stone bench placed on an elevation commanding
an extensive prospect; there a kind of grotto, or an
ivy-covered summer-house; then the dense, extensive,
and gloomy woods, forming a semicircular sweep round
the back of the Hall; all around, nearly as far as the eye
could reach, land of every kind in the highest state of
cultivation, plentifully stocked with fine cattle, and interspersed
with snug and substantial farms.</p>

<p>All this, thought Titmouse, might do very well for
those who fancied that sort of thing; but as for <i>him</i>, how
the devil could he have thought of leaving his cigars
behind him? Where, he wondered, were Yahoo and Fitz-Snooks?
and quickened his pace homeward.</p>

<p>On Gammon the scene which they had been witnessing
had made a profound impression; and as his attention
was now and then called off from contemplating it, by
some ignorant and puerile remark of the proprietor of the
fine domain, he felt a momentary exasperation at himself
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
for the part he had taken in the expulsion of the Aubreys,
and the introduction of such a creature as Titmouse.
That revived certain other thoughts, which led him into
speculations of a description which would have afforded
uneasiness even to the little idiot beside him, could he
have been made aware of them. But the cloud that had
darkened his brow was dispelled by a word or two of
Titmouse. "Mr. Gammon, 'pon my soul you're devilish
dull to-day," said he. Gammon started; and with his
winning smile and cheerful voice, instantly replied, "Oh,
Mr. Titmouse, I was only thinking how happy you are;
and that you deserve it!"</p>

<p>"Yes; 'pon my soul it ought all to have been mine at
my birth!&mdash;Don't it tire you, Mr. Gammon, to walk in
this up-and-down, zig-zag, here-and-there sort of way? It
does <i>me</i>, 'pon my life! What would I give for a cigar at
this moment!"</p>

<p>The next day was the Sabbath, tranquil and beautiful;
and just as the little tinkling bell of Yatton church had
ceased, at half-past ten o'clock, Dr. Tatham rose, in his
reading-desk, and commenced the service. The church
was quite full, for every one was naturally anxious to
catch a glimpse of the new tenants of the squire's pew.
It was empty, however, till about five minutes after the
service had commenced, when a gentleman walked slowly
up to the church door; and having whispered an inquiry
of the old pew-opener which was the squire's pew, she led
him into it&mdash;all eyes settled upon him; and all were
struck with his appearance, his calm keen features, and
gentlemanly figure. 'Twas, of course, Gammon; who,
with the utmost decorum and solemnity, having stood for
half a minute with his hat covering his face, during which
time he reflected that Miss Aubrey had sat in that pew
on the last occasion of his attendance at the church, turned
round, and behaved with the greatest seriousness and reverence
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
throughout the service, paying marked attention to
the sermon. Gammon was an unbeliever, but he thought
Dr. Tatham an amiable and learned enthusiast, but who
was most probably in earnest; and he felt disposed to
admit, as his eye glanced round the attentive and decent
congregation, that the sort of thing was not without its
advantages. Almost all present took him for Titmouse,
and watched every turn of his countenance with intense
interest; and, in their simplicity, they rejoiced that Mr.
Aubrey's successor was, at all events, so grave and respectable-looking
a man; and they fancied that he frequently
thought, with kindness and regret, of those whose seat he
was occupying. About the middle of the service, the
main-door of the church standing wide open, the congregation
beheld three gentlemen, smoking cigars, and laughing
and talking together, approaching the porch. They
were dressed very finely indeed; and were supposed to be
some of the great friends of the new squire. They stopped
when within a few yards of the church; and after whispering
together for a moment, one of them, having expelled
a mouthful of smoke, stepped forward to the door, holding
his cigar in one hand, and with the other taking off his
hat. There was a faint smirk on his face, (for he did not
catch the stern countenance of Gammon anxiously directed
towards him,) till he beheld Dr. Tatham's solemn eye fixed
upon him, while he made a momentary pause. Titmouse
blushed scarlet; made a hesitating but most respectful
bow; and, stepping back a few paces, replaced his hat on
his head, and lit his cigar from that of Mr. Fitz-Snooks,
within view, perhaps unconsciously, of more than half the
congregation. Then the three gentlemen, after Mr. Titmouse
had spoken a word or two to them, burst out into
a laugh, and quitted the churchyard.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>Aubrey's sudden plunge into the cold and deep stream of
trouble, had&mdash;the first shock over&mdash;served, as it were,
to brace his nerves. 'Tis at such a time, and on such an
occasion, that the temper and quality of the soul are tried;
whether it be weak in seeming strength, or strong in seeming
weakness. How many are there, walking with smiling
complacent confidence along the flowery bank, who, if
suddenly bidden to strip and enter, would turn pale and
tremble as they reluctantly prepared to obey the stern
mandate; and, after a convulsive shudder, a faint shriek,
a brief struggle, disappear from the surface, paralyzed,
never to be seen again! In such a point of view, let me
hope that the situation of Aubrey, one of deepening difficulty
and danger&mdash;the issue of which, hid in the darkness
of the future, no earthly intelligence could predict&mdash;will
excite in the thoughtful reader an anxiety not unmingled
with confidence.</p>

<p>The enervating effects of <i>inactivity</i> upon the physical
structure and energies of mankind, few can have failed
to observe. Rust is more fatal to metal than wear. A
thorough-bred racer, if confined in stable or paddock, or
a boxer, born of the finest muscular make, if prematurely
incarcerated in jail, will, after a few years, become
quite unable to compete with those vastly their inferiors
in natural endowments and capabilities; however they
may, with careful training, be restored to the full enjoyment
and exercise of their powers. Thus is it with the
temper and intellect of man, which, secluded from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
scenes of <i>appropriate</i> stimulus and exercise, become relaxed
and weakened. What would have become of the
glorious spirit and powers of Achilles, if his days had all
melted away in the tender, delicate, emasculating inactivity
and indulgence of the court of Lycomedes? The
language of the ancient orator concerning his art may be
applied to <i>life</i>, that not only its greatness, but its enjoyment,
consists in action&mdash;<i>action</i>&mdash;<small>ACTION</small>. The feelings,
for instance, may become so morbidly sensitive, as to give
an appearance of weakness to the whole character; and
this is likely to be specially the case of one born with
those of superior liveliness and delicacy, if he be destined
to move only in the realms of silent and profound
abstraction and contemplation&mdash;in those refined regions
which may be termed a sort of paradise; where every
conceivable source of enjoyment is cultivated for the fortunate
and fastidious occupants, to the very uttermost,
and all those innumerable things which fret, worry, and
harass the temper, the head, and the heart of the dwellers
in the rude regions of ordinary life&mdash;most anxiously
weeded out; instead of entering into the throng of life,
and taking part in its constant cares and conflicts&mdash;scenes
which require all his energies always in exercise,
to keep his place, and escape being trodden under foot.
Rely upon it, that the man who feels a tendency to shrink
from collision with his fellows, to run away with distaste
or apprehension from the great practical business of life,
does not enjoy moral or intellectual health; will quickly
contract a silly conceit and fastidiousness, or sink into
imbecility and misanthropy; and should devoutly thank
Providence for the occasion, however momentarily startling
and irritating, which stirs him out of his lethargy,
his <i>cowardly</i> lethargy, and sends him among his fellows&mdash;puts
him, in a manner, upon a course of training;
upon an experience of comparative suffering, it may be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of sorrow, requiring the exercise of powers of which he
had before scarcely been conscious, and giving him presently
the exhilarating consciousness that he is exhibiting
himself&mdash;a <small>MAN</small>.</p>

<p>"It is probable," says the late Mr. Foster, in his Essay
on "Decision of Character"&mdash;"that the men most distinguished
for decision, have not, in general, possessed a
large share of tenderness: and it is easy to imagine that
the laws according to which our nature is formed, will
with great difficulty allow the combination of the refined
sensibilities, with a hardy, never shrinking, never yielding
constancy. Is it not almost of the essence of this constancy,
to be free from even the <i>perception</i> of such impressions
as cause a mind, weak through susceptibility,
to relax, or to waver?&mdash;No doubt, this firmness consists
partly in overcoming feelings&mdash;but it may consist partly,
too, in not having them." The case I am contemplating
is perhaps the difficult, though by no means, I am persuaded,
uncommon one&mdash;of a person possessing these
delicate sensibilities, these lively feelings; yet with a
native strength of character beneath, which, when the
occasion for its display has arisen&mdash;when it is placed in
a scene of constant and compulsory action, will fully
evince and vindicate itself. It is then "that another
essential principle of decision of character," to quote
from another part of the same essay, "will be displayed;
namely, a total incapability of surrendering to indifference
or delay the serious determinations of the mind. A strenuous
will accompanies the conclusions of thought, and
constantly urges the utmost efforts for their practical accomplishment.
The intellect is invested, as it were, with
a glowing atmosphere of passion, under the influence of
which the cold dictates of reason take fire, and spring
into active powers."</p>

<p>There is, indeed, nothing like throwing a man of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
description we are considering, upon his own resources,
and compelling him to exertion. Listen, ye languid and
often gifted victims of indolence and <i>ennui</i>, to the noble
language of one blessed with as great powers as perhaps
were ever vouchsafed to man&mdash;Edmund Barke!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Difficulty</span> is a severe instructor, set over us by the Supreme
ordinance of a parental guardian and legislator, who
knows us better than we know ourselves, as He loves us better,
too. <i>Pater ipse colendi, haud facilem esse viam voluit.</i> He that
wrestles with us, strengthens our nerves and sharpens our
skill; our antagonist is our helper. This amicable contest
with difficulty, obliges us to an intimate acquaintance with our
object, and compels us to consider it in all its relations; it will
not suffer us to be superficial."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The man, moreover, whose disposition is one of sterling
excellence, despite the few foibles which it may have contracted
in comparative solitude and inactivity, when he
is compelled to mix indiscriminately with the great family
of man, oh, how patient and tolerant becomes he of the
weakness and errors of others, when thus constantly
reminded of, and made to feel his own! Oh, how pitiful!
how very pitiful is he!&mdash;How his heart yearns and
overflows with love, and mercy, and charity towards his
species, <i>individually</i>&mdash;whose eye looks oft on their grievous
privations, their often incurable distress and misery!&mdash;and
who in the spirit of a heavenly philanthropy penetrates
even to those deserted quarters&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where hopeless anguish pours her moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lonely want retires to die!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It may be that some of the preceding observations are
applicable to many individuals of the purest and most
amiable characters, and powerful and cultivated intellects,
in the higher classes of society, whose affluence
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
exempts them from the necessity of actively intermingling
with the concerns of life, and feeling the consciousness
of individual responsibility,&mdash;of having a personal
necessity for anxious care and exertion. They are assured
that a position of real precariousness and danger, is that
which is requisite for developing the energies of a man of
high moral and intellectual character; as it will expose
to destruction one of a contrary description.</p>

<p>I have endeavored, in previous portions of this history,
to delineate faithfully the character of Mr. Aubrey&mdash;one
(how idle and childish would have been the attempt!)
by no means <i>perfect</i>, yet with very high qualities. He
was a man of noble simplicity of character, generous, confiding,
sincere, affectionate: possessing a profound sense
of religion, <i>really influencing his conduct in life;</i> an intellect
of a superior order, of a practical turn, of a masculine
strength&mdash;as had been evidenced by his successful
academical career, his thorough mastery of some of the
most important and difficult branches of human knowledge,
and by his aptitude for public business. He was at
the same time possessed of a sensibility that was certainly
excessive. He had a morbid tendency to pensiveness, if
not melancholy, which, with a feeble <i>physical</i> constitution,
was partly derived from his mother, and partly accounted
for by the species of life which he had led. From
his early youth he had been addicted to close and severe
study, which had given permanence and strength to
his naturally contemplative turn. He had not, moreover,
with too many possessed of his means and station, entered,
just at the dawn and bloom of manhood, upon that
course of dissipation which is a sure and speedy means of
destroying "the freshness of thought and of feeling,"
which "never again can be theirs," and inducing a
<i>lowered tone</i> of feeling, and a callousness which some
seem to consider necessary to enable them to pass through
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
life easily and agreeably. He, on the contrary, had
stepped out of the gloom and solitude of the cloister into
the pure and peaceful region of domestic life, with all its
hallowed and unutterable tendernesses, where the affections
grew luxuriantly; in the constant society of such
women as his mother, his sister, his wife, and latterly his
lovely children. Then he was possessed, all this while,
of a fine fortune&mdash;one which placed him far beyond the
necessity for anxiety or exertion. With such tastes as
these, such a temperament as his, and leading such a life
as his, is it surprising that the tone of his feelings should
have become somewhat relaxed? The three or four years
which he had spent in Parliament, when he plunged into
its fierce and absorbing excitement with characteristic ardor
and determination, though calculated to sharpen the
faculties, and draw forth the resources of his intellect,
subjected him to those alternations of elevation and depression,
those extremes of action and reaction, which
were not calculated to <i>correct</i> his morbid tendencies.</p>

<p>Therefore came there up to him a messenger from
Heaven, with trouble and affliction in his countenance,
telling him to descend from the happy solitude of his
high mountain, into the dismal hubbub and conflict in
the plain beneath. He came down with humility and
awe, and with reverent resignation; and was&mdash;instantly
surrounded!&mdash;</p>

<p>A weak man would have been confused and stunned,
and so sunk helpless into the leaden arms of despair. But
it was not so with Aubrey. There was that dormant energy
within, which, when appealed to, quickly shook off
the weakness contracted by inaction, and told him to <i>be
up and doing</i>; and that, not with the fitfulness of mere
impulse, but the constant strength of a well regulated
mind, conscious of its critical position; and also of a
calm inflexible determination to vanquish difficulty, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
if possible escape the imminent danger, however long and
doubtful might prove the conflict. Above all, he was consoled
and blessed by the conviction, that nothing could
befall him that was not the ordination of Providence,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;"supremely wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alike in what it gives and what denies;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that His was the ordering of the sunshine and the gloom,
the tempest and the calm of life. This was to Aubrey&mdash;this
is&mdash;as the humble writer of these pages (who has
had in his time his measure of anxiety and affliction) has
in his soul a profound and intimate persuasion and conviction
of&mdash;the only source of real fortitude and resignation,
amid the perplexities, and afflictions, and dangers of
life. Depend upon it, that a secret and scarce acknowledged
disbelief, or at least doubt and distrust of the very
existence of God, and of His government of the world&mdash;<small>HIS
REAL PRESENCE AND INTERFERENCE</small> with the men and
the things of the world&mdash;lies at the bottom of almost
all impatience and despair under adverse circumstances.
How can he be impatient, or despairing, who believes not
only the existence of God, and His moral government of
the world, but that He has mercifully vouchsafed to reveal
and declare expressly that the infliction of suffering and
sorrow is directly from Himself, and designed solely for
the advantage of His creatures? <i>If ye endure chastening,
God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom
the father chasteneth not? We have had fathers of our flesh
which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we
not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits,
and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after
their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be
partakers of his holiness. Now, no chastening for the present
seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward
it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
<i>are exercised thereby. Wherefore lift up the hands which
hang down, and the feeble knees.</i> While thus benignantly
teacheth the voice of God, thought Aubrey, shall I rather
incline mine ear to the blighting whisper of the Evil One&mdash;<i>a
liar, and the father of a lie</i>, who would fain that I
should become <i>a fool, saying within my heart there is no
God</i>&mdash;or, if I cannot but believe that there is one, provoking
me to <i>charge Him foolishly, to curse Him and die</i>? Not
so, however, had Aubrey read the Scriptures&mdash;not so had
he learned the Christian religion.</p>

<p>The last time that we caught a glimpse of the ruined
family, they had arrived nearly at the end of their long
and melancholy journey from Yatton to the metropolis.
When before had such been the character of their journey
to town? Had they not ever looked forward with
pleasure towards the brilliant gayeties of the season; their
re-entrance into an extensive and splendid circle of friends&mdash;and
he into the delightful excitement of political life&mdash;the
opening of the parliamentary campaign? Alas, how
changed now all this! how gloomy and threatening the
aspect of the metropolis, whose dusky outskirts they were
entering! With what feelings of oppression&mdash;of vague
indefinite apprehension&mdash;did they now approach it: their
spirits heavy, their hearts bleeding with their recent severance
from Yatton! <i>Now</i>, distress, desertion, dismay,
seemed associated with the formidable name of "London."
They had now no place of their own awaiting,
thoroughly prepared for them, their welcome arrival&mdash;but
must drive to some quiet and inexpensive family hotel
for temporary shelter. As their eyes caught familiar point
after point in their route through the suburbs&mdash;now passed
at a moderate pace, with a modest pair of horses; formerly
dashed past by them in their carriage and four&mdash;there
were very few words spoken by those within the
carriage. Both the children were fast asleep. Poor Kate,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
as they entered Piccadilly, burst into tears: her pent-up
feelings, suddenly gave way, and she cried heartily;
Mrs. Aubrey also weeping. Mr. Aubrey was calm, but
evidently oppressed with profound anxiety. Still he affectionately
grasped their hands, and, in something which
was designed for a cheerful tone and manner, besought
them to restrain their feelings, and thank Heaven that
so far they had got on safely.</p>

<p>"I shall be better presently, Charles," said Miss Aubrey,
passionately, burying her face in her handkerchief, "but
I feel quite <i>afraid</i> of London!"</p>

<p>Over the pavement they rattled, meeting carriages rolling
in all directions&mdash;for it was about the dinner-hour,
and in the height of the season; and it was the casual
but vivid evidence thus afforded of their desolate position,
this sudden glimpse of old familiar scenes, which had momentarily
overcome the fortitude of Miss Aubrey. They
drove to a quiet family hotel in a retired street running parallel
with Piccadilly; they were all wearied, both in mind
and body, and after a very slight repast, and much anxious
and desponding conversation, they bade each other
affectionate adieus, and retired to rest. They rose in the
morning refreshed with repose, and in a much more tranquil
mood of mind than could have been expected.</p>

<p>"Now we enter," said Aubrey, with a cheerful smile,
"upon the real business of life; so we must discard sentiment&mdash;we
must not think of the past, but the future."</p>

<p>At their request, they, shortly after breakfast, accompanied
him to the house agent who had been commissioned
by Mr. Runnington to look out two or three residences
from which, on their arrival in town, they might easily
select that deemed most suitable for their purposes. One
was particularly recommended to them; and after due inquiry,
within three days after their arrival in town, they
engaged it. 'Twas a small, but convenient, airy, and comfortable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
house, within five minutes' walk of Hyde Park,
and situated in Vivian Street&mdash;a recently completed one&mdash;and
as quiet and retired as they could have wished. The
rent, too, was moderate&mdash;fifty pounds a-year. Though
none of the houses in the street were large, they were all
strictly private residences, and had an air of thorough respectability.
Mr. Aubrey's house had but one window to
the dining-room, and two to the drawing-room. The passage
and staircase were sufficiently commodious, as were the
chief apartments. At the back of the house was a small
garden, about twenty yards in length, and about ten yards
in width, with several lilacs, laburnums, and shrubs; and
a considerable portion of the wall was covered with ivy.
Was not this a delightful place for the children to play
about in? The back parlor, a somewhat small one certainly,
looked into this garden, and was at once appropriated
to be a library for Mr. Aubrey. Within a week's
time, all their luggage, furniture, &amp;c., had arrived in town
from Yatton; and they had quite sufficient to furnish their
little residence out of the wreck of the equipments of the
old Hall&mdash;adapted as it was, under the tasteful superintendence
of Mrs. and Miss Aubrey, with equal regard to
elegance, simplicity, and economy. How busy were they
all for a fortnight! Many and many an irrepressible sigh,
and rebellious tear, would the sight of these old familiar
objects, in their new situation, occasion them! Some half
dozen family pictures hung upon the wall. Over the mantel-piece
was suspended a piece of beautiful embroidery&mdash;by
poor old Mrs. Aubrey, many years before&mdash;of the arms
of the family. In the dining-room was the old high-backed
chair in which she had sat for twenty years and more. In
the drawing-room was Miss Aubrey's favorite ebony inlaid
cabinet, and Mrs. Aubrey's piano; and, in short, everywhere
might be seen the delicate traces of dear, dear,
graceful, and elegant <i>woman</i>&mdash;touching nothing that she
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
adorns not! What with the silk curtains, and a carpet
of simple but tasteful pattern, and the various articles of
furniture and ornament, all possessing a kind of <i>old family
air</i>&mdash;all from Yatton, I declare there was a sort of richness
about the general aspect of the drawing-room; and
when Mrs. Aubrey and Kate came to fetch Mr. Aubrey
out of his little library to witness the completion of their
labors, he gazed round him for a while, looked at each
object, and then at the two dear fond beings standing beside
him, awaiting his opinion with womanly eagerness;
but he could not express his feelings. He kissed each of
them very tenderly and in silence, and then they were a
little overcome. His library, also, though <i>very</i> small, was
as snug and comfortable as a bookworm could have desired.
All the sides were covered with books, and in the
middle were the library-table and armchair which he had
used in Grosvenor Street, and which were, it must be
owned, on too large a scale for the little room to which
they had been removed.</p>

<p>That this oppressed family were not incessantly and
very painfully reminded of the contrast afforded by their
present to their former circumstances, I do not pretend to
assert; but it very, very seldom formed a topic of <i>conversation</i>
between any of them. When, however, the little
bustle and occupation of arranging their house was over,
and Mrs. Aubrey and Kate were left a good deal to themselves&mdash;Mr.
Aubrey being either absent from home, or
in his library, engaged in matters of the last importance
to them all&mdash;then they would talk together with increasing
eagerness and excitement about past times, and their
recent troubles and bereavements; not displaying then&mdash;sweet
souls!&mdash;<i>quite</i> that degree of resignation and fortitude
which they strove to exhibit in the presence of Mr.
Aubrey.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></div></div>
They passed a good deal of their time in-doors in needlework,
<i>practical</i> family needlework, an art in which they
were not particularly accomplished, but which they quickly
acquired from a seamstress whom they kept engaged constantly
in the house for several weeks. Then sometimes
they would sit down to the piano; at other times they
would read&mdash;on all occasions, however, frequently falling
into conversation on the all-engrossing topic of their expulsion
from Yatton. Now and then, they could scarcely
refrain from a melancholy smile, when they remarked
upon their shrunken personal importance. "Really,
Agnes," said one day Miss Aubrey, "I feel just as one
can fancy a few poor newly shorn sheep must feel! So
light and cold! So much <i>less</i> than they were half an
hour before! Surely they must hardly know what to
make of themselves!"

<p>"Then, I suppose, mamma," said Charles, who was
sitting on a stool beside them&mdash;making believe to write
on a small slate&mdash;"I am a <i>little</i> sheep?" They both
looked at the child with silent tenderness, and presently
thought of Him who "<i>tempers the wind</i> to the shorn
lamb."</p>

<p>Their proximity to the parks was delightful, and many
a pleasant hour did they pass there with the children;
and then returning home, would occupy themselves with
writing letters&mdash;and long ones they usually were&mdash;to
early and loved friends, especially to Dr. Tatham, with
whom Miss Aubrey kept up a constant correspondence.
I ought to have mentioned before, that Mr. Aubrey, in
bringing his favorite valet up to town with him, had no
other design than, with that kind thoughtfulness for which
he was remarkable, to have an opportunity of securing for
him a good situation; and that he succeeded in doing,
after about a fortnight's interval; but the poor fellow was
quite confounded when he first heard that he was to quit
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
the service of Mr. Aubrey, and, almost falling on his knees,
begged to be permitted to continue and receive no wages,
and he should be a happy man. Mr. Aubrey was, however,
firm; and on parting with him, which he did with
no little emotion, put two guineas into his hand as a
present, and wished him health and happiness. The poor
fellow's deep distress at parting with the family sensibly
affected them all, and reminded them vividly of one of
the latest and bitterest scenes at Yatton. On his departure,
their little establishment consisted but of three female
servants, a cook, a housemaid, and a nursery-maid. It
took them some little time to familiarize themselves with
the attendance of a female servant at dinner! That was
one little matter&mdash;and another was Charles' now and
then complaining of being tired, and inquiring why his
mamma did not drive in the carriage as she used to do,
and how he should like to go with her!&mdash;which brought
home to them, in a lively manner, their altered circumstances&mdash;their
fallen fortunes. Many, many were the
anxious calculations they made together, of the probable
amount of their annual expenditure&mdash;which at length,
inexperienced as they were, they fixed at from £300 to
£400, including everything; his wife and sister eagerly
assuring Mr. Aubrey, and persuading each other, that as
for clothes&mdash;<i>their</i> wardrobe would, with care, last them
for three or four years to come&mdash;so that <i>that</i> was an item
which might be almost altogether excluded from the account;
except by the way, the children&mdash;yes, <i>they</i> should
be always well-dressed; that all agreed upon. Then there
was their education&mdash;oh, Kate would see to <i>that</i>! Could
they, in this manner, with rigid and persevering economy,
hold on their way for a year or two? was a question they
often asked one another, with beating hearts. If they
could, then, they said, they should be happy; for they had
<i>health</i>&mdash;they had peace of mind; their consciences were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
not oppressed by a sense of misconduct&mdash;and they were
able to put their trust in Providence.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey resolved to live in strict privacy; and they
consequently communicated their residence to but one or
two of their numerous friends, and to them only in confidence.
To have acted otherwise, would have seriously
interfered with the arrangements which, long ago contemplated,
he had now fixed upon. It would have been perpetually
calling their attention to the contrast between
former days and scenes, and the present; opening their
wounds afresh; and moreover, subjecting them to kind
and generous importunities and offers, which, however delicate,
would have been exquisitely painful and trying to
an honorable pride. But it is time that I should proceed
to give a more particular account of the position,
the personal feelings, and the purposes and prospects of
Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>From the moment when he received the first intimation
of the desperate assault about to be made upon his
fortunes, he felt a conviction&mdash;whether arising from weakness,
or superstition, or any other cause it concerns me
not here to say&mdash;that the issue would be a disastrous
one for him; and, the first alarm and confusion over, he
addressed himself with serious calmness, with deep anxiety,
to the determination of his future course of life. A
man of his refined taste and feeling would inevitably appreciate
exquisitely&mdash;with, indeed, a most agonizing intensity&mdash;the
loss of all those superior enjoyments&mdash;the
deliciæ of life&mdash;to which he had been from his birth accustomed.
<i>Semper enim delicatè ac molliter vixit.</i> I speak
not here of the mere exterior "appliances and means" of
wealth and station, but of the fastidious and sensitive condition
of <i>feeling</i> and temper, which such a state of things
is calculated to engender in a person of his description.
He could part with the one; but how could he divest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
himself of the other? Even had he been alone in the
world, and not surrounded with objects of the tenderest
regard, whose safety or ruin was involved in his own,
one of the results of his opponent's success&mdash;namely,
his claim to the mesne profits&mdash;was calculated to fetter
all his movements, to hang like a millstone round his
neck; and that effect, indeed, it had. Still he played
the man&mdash;resolved to act promptly, and with the best
consideration he could give to his critical position. He
had not yet reached the prime of life; had a fair share
of health; had been blessed with the inestimable advantages
of a thorough&mdash;a first-rate education&mdash;and, above
all, had followed out his early advantages by laborious
and systematic study. He had not only made accurate,
extensive, and valuable acquisitions of knowledge, but
learned how to use them&mdash;to turn them to practical
account. What would, he thought, have become of him,
had he&mdash;or those before him&mdash;neglected his education?
Then he had acquired a considerable familiarity with business
habits, in the House of Commons; and had friends
and connections who might be of essential service to him,
if he could but first succeed in acquiring such a position
as would enable him to avail himself of their good offices.
Surely all <i>these</i> were cheering considerations! Had he
not even advantages superior to those possessed by many
in entering upon some one of the scenes of honorable
struggles for a livelihood, and even for distinction? He
surveyed all the professions with much deliberation. The
army and navy were of course out of the question. There
was the <i>Church:</i> but no&mdash;his soul recoiled from the degradation
and guilt of entering that holy calling from
mercenary motives, merely as a means of acquiring a livelihood;
and he would rather have perished, than prefer
the prayer uttered by the doomed descendants of one
whose lamentable case is left on record&mdash;who <i>came and</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
<i>crouched for a piece of silver, and a morsel of bread, saying,
Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priest's offices, that I
may eat a piece of bread.</i><a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> A personage of very high distinction
in the Church&mdash;of eminent piety and learning&mdash;who
was aware of the misfortunes of Aubrey, and well
acquainted with his pure and exemplary character&mdash;his
learning and acquirements&mdash;his fitness for the ministerial
office&mdash;wrote to him, offering him every facility for
taking orders, and assuring him that he need not wait
long before he should be placed in a situation of public
usefulness. Though he assured Mr. Aubrey that he believed
himself consulting the best interests, both of Mr.
Aubrey and of the Church&mdash;the scruples of Mr. Aubrey
were not to be overcome; and he wrote to the kind and
venerable prelate, a letter declining his offers, and assigning
reasons which filled him with profound respect for
Mr. Aubrey. Then literature, for which&mdash;for real substantial
literature&mdash;he possessed superior qualifications,
was proverbially precarious. As for <i>teaching</i>&mdash;he felt
quite unfit for it; he had not the least inclination for
it; 'twas a cheerless scene of exertion; in which, as it
were, he felt his energies <i>perishing in the using</i>. The
<span class="smcap">Bar</span> was the profession to which his tastes and inclinations,
and, he hoped, his qualifications, pointed him. One
of the first things he did, on reaching London, was to
apply for information to one consummately qualified to
guide him in the matter. He wrote to the Attorney-General,
soliciting an interview at his chambers upon the
subject of entering the profession; and received an immediate
answer, appointing ten o'clock on Saturday, on
which day the Attorney-General expected to be partially
free from public engagements. Precisely at that hour,
Mr. Aubrey entered the chambers of that distinguished
person, whose arrival he had anticipated. Poor Aubrey
felt a little nervous and depressed as the fussy clerk
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
showed him into the room&mdash;<i>as he fancied</i>, and only fancied&mdash;with
an air of patronizing civility, as if aware of
his diminished personal consequence. He stood for a
minute or two very close to Mr. Aubrey, with a sort of
confidence in his manner as he rubbed his hands, and
glibly observed on the innumerable engagements of the Attorney-General,
which slightly&mdash;<i>very slightly</i>&mdash;displeased
Mr. Aubrey, suggesting the idea of undue familiarity. He
answered the voluble clerk therefore courteously, but with
an evident disinclination to prolong the conversation, and
was quickly left alone. Poor Aubrey's pride had taken
the alarm. Was it possible that the man had been presuming
to give him a hint not to occupy much of the
Attorney-General's time? Was it even possible that it
had been done in consequence of an intimation from the
Attorney-General himself? Oh, no&mdash;his own good sense
came presently to his assistance, and banished so absurd
a notion. There were three tables in the room, and each
was laden with briefs, some of them of prodigious bulk.
Seven or eight very recent ones were placed on the table
opposite to which his vacant chair was standing; the very
sight of all this oppressed Aubrey: how could one man's
head manage so much? He was ruminating on such matters&mdash;and
especially upon the powerful, versatile, and
practised intellect which was requisite successfully to cope
with such perpetually accumulating difficulties, independently
of the harassing responsibilities and occupations of
political office, when the Attorney-General entered. He
was a tall and handsome man, about forty-five, with an
extremely graceful and gentlemanlike carriage. There
was a slight dash of negligence in it; while his manner
was fraught with cheerful composure. He looked quite
a man of the world; you would have thought that he
could have nothing to do but lounge at his club; ride
round the Park; saunter into the House of Lords for an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
hour or two; and then surrender himself to the pleasures
of society. There was not a trace of anxiety or exhaustion
about him; yet had he been engaged during the
whole of the preceding day conducting a very great political
cause, (one of high treason,) not having concluded his
reply till nine o'clock at night! There was a playful smile
about his mouth; his ample forehead seemed unfurrowed
by a wrinkle; and his bright penetrating hazel eyes seemed
never the worse for wear with all the tens of thousands of
brief sheets on which they had travelled for the last twenty
years.</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;Aubrey&mdash;I'm a few minutes behind time, I'm
afraid!&mdash;How are you?" said he, with a cheerful air,
grasping his saddened visitor very cordially by the hand.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Attorney&mdash;<i>Cum tot sustineas, et
tanta negotia solus</i>"&mdash;commenced poor Aubrey, pointing
to the piles of briefs.</p>

<p>"Pho, my dear Aubrey; nonsense! <i>They've</i> enough
of my time, surely, without grudging me half an hour's
conversation with a friend&mdash;ah, ha!" They were both
quickly seated&mdash;and within a minute or two's time the
Attorney-General&mdash;<i>more suo</i>&mdash;had <i>got to business</i>&mdash;the
business of the visit. Aubrey perceived the rapidity of
the movement; but nothing could be <i>kinder</i> than the
manner of his companion, however distinct and decisive
his intimation that time was very precious. He approved
entirely of Mr. Aubrey's coming to the bar, and strongly
recommended him not to lose one day in entering upon
the serious practical study of it; informing him that, as
an university man, within three years' time he would be
eligible to be called to the bar. "I'll call you myself,
Aubrey, if you will allow me," said he; but before that
period had arrived, he had taken his seat upon the Woolsack,
as Lord High Chancellor of England!</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," said he, among other things, when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
pressed by Aubrey about the difficulties to be encountered
in adopting the legal profession&mdash;"the acquisition
of the <i>technical</i> knowledge will be for some little time
rather troublesome; but a twelvemonth's steady study
by a man who is in earnest, and accustomed to real
<i>work</i>, will make a vast inroad on it. Everything you
master, you see, helps to master so much more. Three
years' serious application to the law, by a man like you,
my dear Aubrey, will place you far a-head of the mob of
men at the bar. Besides, 'tis not the study but the <i>practice</i>
of the law that teaches law most effectually.... Always
have an eye to <i>principle</i>, referring <i>everything</i> to it.
Resolve thoroughly to understand the smallest details;
and it will be a wonderful assistance in fixing them for
practical use in your mind, to learn as much as you can,
of the <i>reasons</i> and <i>policy</i> in which they originated. You'll
find Reeves' History of the English Law of infinite service
to you; I should study it in the evenings; 'tis full of interest
and value in every point of view. I read every
word of it, very carefully, soon after I left college; and,
by the way, I'll tell you another book, by which I did
the same&mdash;the State Trials: ay, you could hardly believe
me, if I were to tell you how much I have read of them&mdash;speeches,
examinations, cross-examination of witnesses,
reply, and summing up. That's where I first learned how
to examine and cross-examine a witness! Consider, the
counsel employed were, you know, generally first-rate men,
and exerted themselves, on such occasions, to the utmost,
and the records of their procedure show you the best possible
style of doing business. And there you also learn a
great deal of <i>constitutional</i> law.... You ask me how I
get through so much? To be sure, one <i>has</i> enough to do,
and I'm afraid I neglect a good deal; but the great secret
is&mdash;<i>attention</i>, and to <i>one thing</i> at a time. The sun's rays
scattered are comparatively powerless; condense them,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
they are irresistible:&mdash;but all this you know, Aubrey, as
well as, or better than I do.... Certainly, law is difficult;
but its difficulty is often greatly overrated, especially
by imperfectly educated, and ill-disciplined, <i>quick</i>,
<i>sharp</i> men. <i>You</i> will find it a very different matter.
What is wanted is a clear head; a good memory; strong
common sense; fixity of purpose; an aptitude for analysis
and arrangement: before these combined, the difficulties
of law fly like the morning mist before the sun.&mdash;<i>Tact</i>
with the court, and a jury, is acquired by practice,
to a considerable extent, in the absence even of natural
endowments. And as for <i>you</i>, Aubrey&mdash;upon my honor,
I've often listened with great satisfaction to you in the
House; few ever made clearer statements of facts, or
reasoned more closely and cogently than you did; with
practice, you would have become&mdash;and you soon will
become&mdash;a formidable debater. In your new profession
you will find <i>facts</i> become quite different things from what
they have ever hitherto appeared; flexible, elastic, accommodating&mdash;you
may do anything with them&mdash;twist,
and turn, and combine; ha! ha! Aubrey!" [Here the
Attorney-General laughed in the plenitude of his own
conscious power.] "In a word, Aubrey, if you <i>determine</i>
to get on at the bar, you <i>will</i>: and if you can but get a
bit of a <i>start</i> at the beginning; now, for instance, there's
Runningtons' house&mdash;one of the very first in London&mdash;why
if <i>they</i> would push you&mdash;your fortune's made. But
you must make up your mind to wait a little: you can't
get into a great business by a hop, step, and a jump, believe
me. Certainly <i>I</i> have no cause to be dissatisfied;
I've done pretty well; but I can tell you that eight years
passed over me before I earned enough a-year to pay my
laundress! With me, accident supplied the place of <i>connection</i>:
but only suppose how I must have worked in the
mean time to be able to do business when it came to me!
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
I know it's said that I was always an idle man; but
people were a good deal mistaken about that matter, I
can promise them! What <i>idiots</i>, indeed, to suppose such
a thing! Why, my very first start lifted me into a business
of a thousand a-year; and, in the name of common
sense, how could I have got through it, if I hadn't worked
beforehand? Bah!&mdash;Now, if Runningtons'&mdash;one of the
first firms in the profession&mdash;will stand by you, I'll guarantee
your making £300 your first year! and if they
<i>won't</i>, why, don't despair, you'll have to wait a little
longer; but it will come at last, depend on it, if you continue
on the look-out! Besides, you can help <i>me</i> a little
bit, eh? It will be a sort of introduction, you know; but
we've time enough to see about that.&mdash;I recommend you
to get at once into the chambers of some hard-working
man, with a good deal of general business, particularly
Pleading&mdash;let me see"&mdash;Here the Attorney-General
paused, and stroked his chin for a moment or two in a
musing manner, "Ah, yes, there's <span class="smcap">Weasel</span>, the very man
for your purpose. He's a good pleader, and a neat draftsman;
gets through his work very <i>cleanly</i>&mdash;ah! Weasel's
a clear-headed painstaking little fellow&mdash;all for law; and
he's got a good deal of it. He's not a very polished person,
Weasel, ha! ha! but he's an honorable, right-minded
man&mdash;shall I introduce you? Well, by-and-by, I'll walk
over with you.&mdash;As to books? oh! why&mdash;I suppose
you've looked into Blackstone? He's a fine fellow, Blackstone,
and deserves all that has been said in his praise.
Many think that he's only to be glanced at, at the beginning
of their studies; never believe it! He's good to the
end of the chapter! I've a profound respect for Blackstone;
it's the only book I've read four or five times
through&mdash;ay, from cover to cover; he makes law lovely!
Stick to Blackstone by all means! Reeves&mdash;oh! I mentioned
<i>him</i>, you know. Then I should go, I think, to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Coke on Littleton; but we shall have several opportunities
of talking over <i>these</i> matters. I really believe, Aubrey,
that you are doing a very wise thing in coming to
the bar. If you've health, and the average opportunities,
(though I think you will have <i>more</i>,) I'll undertake to
say that in a few years' time you will realize an income&mdash;which
<i>may</i> be a great one&mdash;but which (whatever it
may be) you'll <i>earn</i>, as you did not the one you've lost;
and you'll enjoy it, my dear Aubrey, ten thousand times
more! All that I can do for you, I will&mdash;command me!
By the way," he added, assuming a somewhat anxious expression
of countenance and a manner very different from
that free, buoyant, off-hand one in which, for the last
twenty minutes, he had been speaking, (Aubrey feeling
all the while the easy commanding power and simplicity
of the resplendent intellect with which he was communing,)
"I'm almost afraid to ask; but how do you come
on, about the&mdash;&mdash;Mesne Profits?"</p>

<p>"I have heard nothing whatever about them, as yet,"
replied Aubrey, sighing; his face suddenly overshadowed
with gloom. A moment's pause ensued; which was interrupted
by the Attorney-General saying in a very earnest
and feeling manner, "I hope to Heaven you'll be able
to get some favorable arrangement made! You've not
seen anything of Mr. Titmouse's attorneys, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" replied Aubrey, sighing, "nor heard anything
from them!"</p>

<p>"<i>I've</i> had very little to do with them; Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap&mdash;these are the people, eh?" Mr. Aubrey
nodded. "Quirk is a stubborn wooden-headed fellow&mdash;an
old hedgehog! Egad! that man's compounded more
felonies, the old scamp, than any man in England! I
should like to have him in the witness-box for a couple of
hours, or so! I think I'd tickle him a little," said the
Attorney-General, with a bitter smile. "They say he's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
a confidential adviser to a sort of Thieves' Association!
But there's Gammon: I've had several things to do with
<i>him</i>. He is a superior man, that Gammon, a very superior
man. A keen dog! I recollect him being principal
witness in a cause when I was for the plaintiff; and he
completely baffled Subtle&mdash;ah, ha, how well I recollect it!&mdash;Subtle
lost his temper at last, because he couldn't
make Gammon lose <i>his</i>! Ah, how cleverly the fellow
twisted and turned with Subtle for nearly an hour! ah,
ha&mdash;Subtle looked so chagrined!&mdash;Have you seen Mr.
Gammon?"</p>

<p>"No, I've had no occasion."</p>

<p>"He has a pleasing, gentlemanlike appearance; rather
a striking face. <i>He's</i> the man you'll have to deal with
in any negotiations on the subject I named. You must
mind what you're about with him. You mustn't think
me intrusive, Aubrey; but, have they sent in their bill
yet?"</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey involuntarily shuddered, as he answered in
the negative.</p>

<p>"I'd give a trifle to know how the plague such people
ever came to be concerned in such a case. 'Tis quite out
of their way&mdash;which is in the criminal line of business!&mdash;They'll
make their client pay for it through the nose,
I warrant him:&mdash;By the way, what an inconceivably
ridiculous little ass that Titmouse is&mdash;I saw him in court
at York. If he'd only go on the stage, and act <i>naturally</i>,
he'd make his fortune as a fool!"&mdash;Mr. Aubrey faintly
smiled at this sally; but the topics which the Attorney-General
had just before touched upon, had not a little
oppressed his spirits.</p>

<p>"As this is comparatively an idle day with me," said
the Attorney-General, "and I've got ten minutes more
at your service&mdash;suppose I go with you at once&mdash;nothing
like the present moment&mdash;to Mr. Weasel's?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am greatly obliged to you," replied Aubrey&mdash;and
both rose to go. "Say I shall be back in a few minutes,"
said the Attorney-General, in answer to his clerk, who
reminded him as he passed, that Mr. Sergeant Squelch
and Mr. Putty would be there in a moment or two's
time. As they crossed the court&mdash;"How do you do,
Mr. Putty?" said the Attorney-General, with lofty civility,
to a grinning little confident personage who met
him, exclaiming with flippant familiarity, "How do you
do, Mr. Attorney?&mdash;Coming to your chambers&mdash;you
don't forget?&mdash;Consultation&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I perfectly recollect it, Mr. Putty, I shall return
presently. Perhaps, if convenient, you will have the
goodness to wait for a few minutes"&mdash;replied the
Attorney-General, somewhat stiffly, and passed on, arm-in-arm
with Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Now, that forward little imp's name, Aubrey, is
Putty," whispered the Attorney-General. "He was a
glazier by trade; but just as he finished his apprenticeship,
an uncle left him a few hundred pounds, with which&mdash;would
you believe it?&mdash;nothing would suit him but
decking himself in a wig and gown, and coming to the
bar&mdash;ah, ha!&mdash;The fellow's creeping, however, into a
little business, positively! They say he has a cousin who
is one of the officers to the sheriff of Middlesex, and puts
a good many little things in his way! He's my junior
in an action of libel against a newspaper, for charging
his father-in-law&mdash;a baker who supplies some workhouse
with bread&mdash;with making it of only one-third flour, one-third
rye, and the remainder <i>saw-dust</i>&mdash;ah, ha, ha!&mdash;I
dared hardly look at the judges while I moved the
Rule for a New Trial, for fear of laughing! This is the
case in which we're going to have the consultation he
spoke of&mdash;but here's Mr. Weasel's." They mounted a
narrow, dingy-looking, well-worn staircase&mdash;and on the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
first floor, beheld "<span class="smcap">Mr. Weasel</span>" painted over the door.
On the Attorney-General's knocking, as soon as his clear
silvery voice was heard asking for Mr. Weasel, and his
dignified figure had been recognized by the clerk, who
had one pen in his mouth, and another behind his ear&mdash;that
humble functionary suddenly bent himself almost
double three or four times; and with flustered obsequiousness
assured the great man that Mr. Weasel was quite
at liberty. The next moment the Attorney-General and
Mr. Aubrey were introduced into Mr. Weasel's room&mdash;a
small dusky apartment wretchedly furnished, the walls
being lined with book-shelves, well filled&mdash;and the table
at which he was writing, and a chair on each side of him,
strewed with draft paper, which he was covering at a
prodigious rate. He was, in fact, drawing a "Declaration"
in an action for a <i>Breach of promise of Marriage</i>,
(taking a hasty pinch of fiery Welsh snuff every three
minutes;) and his task seemed to be rendered very difficult,
by the strange conduct of the defendant&mdash;surely
the most fickle of mankind&mdash;who, with an extraordinary
inconsistency, not knowing his own mind for a day together,
had promised to marry Miss M'Squint, the heart-broken
plaintiff, <i>firstly</i>, within a reasonable time; <i>secondly</i>,
on a given day; <i>thirdly</i>, on the defendant's return from
the Continent; <i>fourthly</i>, on the death of his father, (both
of which events were averred to have taken place;) <i>fifthly</i>,
when the defendant should have cut his wise teeth, (which
it was averred he had;) and lastly, on "<i>being requested</i>"
by the lady&mdash;which it was averred she had done, and in
the most precise and positive manner, that she had been
<i>ready and willing, and then</i> [what will the ladies say?]
"<i>tendered and offered herself to marry the said defendant</i>,"
who had then wholly neglected and refused to do any
such thing. One notable peculiarity of the case was,
that all these promises had been made, and all these
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
events appeared to have come to pass in one particular
place&mdash;and that rather an odd one, viz. in "<i>the parish
of Saint Mary Le Bow, in the ward of Cheap, in the city
of London</i>."<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> If you had been better acquainted with
Mr. Weasel's associations and mode of doing business,
you would have discovered that, in <i>his</i> imagination, almost
all the occurrences of life took place at this same
spot! But to return&mdash;thus was that astute little pleader
engaged when they entered. He was a bachelor, upwards
of forty; was of spare make, of low stature, had a thin,
sharp, sallow face, and short stiff black hair; there was
an appearance about the eyes as if they were half-blinded
with being incessantly directed to white paper; he had a
furrowed forehead, a small pursed-up mouth&mdash;one hardly
knew why, but really there was something about his look
that instantly suggested to you the image of the creature
whose name he bore. He was a ravenous lawyer, darting
at the point and pith of every case he was concerned in,
and sticking to it&mdash;just as would his bloodthirsty namesake
at the neck of a rabbit. In <i>law</i> he lived, moved,
and had his being. In his dreams he was everlastingly
spinning out pleadings which he never could understand,
and hunting for cases which he could not discover. In
the daytime, however, he was more successful. In fact,
everything he saw, heard, or read of&mdash;wherever he was,
whatever he was doing, suggested to him questions of
law, that might arise out of it. At his sister's wedding
(whither he had not gone without reluctance) he got into
a wrangle with the bridegroom, on a question started by
himself, (Weasel,) whether an <i>infant</i> was liable for goods
supplied to his wife, before marriage. At his grandmother's
funeral he got into an intricate discussion with
a puzzled proctor about <i>bona notabilia</i>, with reference to
a pair of horn spectacles, which the venerable deceased
had left behind her in Scotland, and a poodle in the Isle
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of Man; and at church, the reading of the parable of
the <i>Unjust Steward</i>, set his devout, ingenious, and fertile
mind at work for the remainder of the service, as to the
modes of stating the case, now-a-days, against the offender,
and whether it would be more advisable to proceed
civilly or criminally; and if the former, at law or
in equity. He was a hard-headed man; very clear and
acute, and accurate in his legal knowledge; every other
sort he despised, if, indeed, he had more than the faintest
notion, from hearsay, of its existence. He was a Cambridge
man; and there had read nothing but mathematics,
in which he had made a decent figure. As soon
as he had taken his degree, he migrated to the Temple,
where he had ever since continued engaged in the study,
and then the successful practice, of the law, as a special
pleader under the bar. He had a very large business,
which he got through ably and rapidly. He scarcely ever
went into society; early want of opportunity for doing so,
had at length abated his desire for it&mdash;to say nothing of
his want of <i>time</i>. When, as was seldom the case, he ventured
out for a walk, he went, muttering to himself, at a
postman's pace, to get the greatest quantity of exercise in
the smallest space of time. He was not a bad-tempered
man, but, from the absorbing and harassing nature of his
employments, he had become nervous, fidgety, and irritable.
His tone of voice was feeble, his utterance hesitating,
his manner hurried. What a laughable contrast
between him and his visitor! The Attorney-General coming
to Mr. Weasel's chambers, suggested the idea of a
magnificent mastiff suddenly poking his head into the
little kennel of a querulous pug-dog; and I suppose Mr.
Aubrey might be likened to a greyhound accompanying
the aforesaid mastiff! On seeing his visitors, Mr. Weasel
instantly got up with a blush of surprise, and a little
hurry and embarrassment of manner. His clerk put out
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
a couple of chairs, and down they sat. The Attorney-General
came to the point in about half a minute, and
the matter was very quickly settled; it being arranged
that within a day or two's time, as soon as the forms
necessary for admitting Mr. Aubrey to an Inn of Court
should have been completed, he should commence his
attendance at Mr. Weasel's, from ten o'clock till five
daily.</p>

<p>"It's a comical-looking little animal, isn't it?" quoth
the Attorney-General, with a laugh, as soon as they had
got out of hearing.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I don't feel particularly prepossessed"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, pho! He's the very man for you&mdash;the very man.
There's no nonsense with Weasel; you may learn an infinite
deal of law from him, and that is all you want. He's
a very inoffensive fellow; and I've no doubt you'll soon
like his chambers greatly, if you're in earnest in studying
the law. You go or not, of course, as you choose; whatever
you do is perfectly voluntary; pay him his hundred
guineas, and then, if you like, you may get many thousand
pounds' worth out of him in the twelvemonth. Now,
I <i>must</i> bid you good-morning&mdash;I've really not another
moment to spare. God bless you, my dear Aubrey; and,"
he added with great kindness, and a very pointed manner,
"whenever you may think it worth your while to talk
over your affairs with me, come without notice or ceremony&mdash;wherever
I may be, I shall be delighted to see
you!" Then they parted. Mr. Aubrey was not aware
of a certain stroke of delicacy and generosity on the part
of the Attorney-General; viz. that immediately on the
<i>Rule</i> for a new trial being discharged, he had sent for Mr.
Runnington, and insisted on returning every sixpence of
his fees&mdash;upwards of six hundred guineas&mdash;desiring that
Mr. Aubrey should not be made acquainted with it, if by
any means Messrs. Runnington could conceal it from him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>A little fatigued and harassed by several important
matters, which kept him engaged till a late hour in the
afternoon, he reached Vivian Street in a depressed and
desponding mood. Just as he turned the corner, he beheld,
at about twenty yards' distance, Mrs. Aubrey and
Miss Aubrey slowly walking homeward, on their return
from the Park. Mrs. Aubrey held Charles by the hand,
who was dancing and frisking wildly about, and Miss Aubrey's
beautiful little Cato she was leading along by a
slender chain. They were in half-mourning; there was
such an air of elegant simplicity about them&mdash;their figures,
their carriage, so easy and graceful! Aubrey, as
he neared them, gazed at them with mingled feelings of
pride and tenderness.</p>

<p>"Oh, my papa! my papa!" suddenly exclaimed Charles,
who, happening to turn round, had caught sight of his
father, and ran eagerly down to him: with what a thrill
of love did he take in his arms the beautiful breathless
boy, and how his heart yearned towards his wife and sister,
as they also turned quickly round to meet him, after a
long day's absence! How inexpressibly dear were they
to him&mdash;how, that day, he enjoyed their quiet little
dinner-table&mdash;the romp with his children afterwards&mdash;and
a long evening of eager and interesting conversation,
after the little ones had gone to bed, Mrs. Aubrey and
Kate busy, the while, with some slight matter of needlework!
They had received several letters from Yorkshire,
which they read to him. One was from poor Dr. Tatham,
who, though he concealed a good deal that would have
occasioned needless pain, yet gave them a melancholy
notion of the altered state of things at the Hall. Though
it was rather late before they retired to rest on the evening
of the ensuing Sunday, Mr. Aubrey was to be found
seated in his study by half-past four on Monday morning,
perusing, with profound attention, stimulated by the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
strong observation of the Attorney-General, the second
volume of Blackstone's Commentaries,&mdash;a work with
which he had already a very tolerable familiarity. 'Twas
really a thing to be thankful for that Mr. Aubrey, with
so many absorbing anxieties, such distracting apprehensions
concerning the future, <i>could</i> command his attention
in the way he did. To be sure, he felt that it was plainly
life-and-death work with him; but he might have derived
great encouragement from perceiving himself possessed of
that faculty of concentrating the attention, which the
Attorney-General had spoken of as so essential an attribute
of a lawyer. The way in which he parcelled out his
time was this: From the time that he entered his study
till breakfast-time, he resolved to read law&mdash;from ten
o'clock till four or five, was to be spent at Mr. Weasel's
chambers&mdash;and the evenings were to be devoted to the
society of his children, his wife, and sister, and also to
certain occasional literary efforts, from which he hoped to
derive some little increase to his means. This was severe
work; but it was probably the most fortunate and salutary
thing in the world for Aubrey, that his energies
should be thus occupied, and his mind kept from the
corroding effects of constant reflection upon his misfortunes,
and dismal apprehensions concerning the future.
After he had spent a few days in Mr. Weasel's chambers,
a good deal of his prejudice against that gentleman began
to wear off. Mr. Aubrey found him all that the Attorney-General
had described him as being&mdash;a very acute and
able lawyer, with a constant current of important, varied,
and instructive business running through his chambers,
and every disposition to render his utmost assistance to
Mr. Aubrey, whom he quickly found out to be a man of
very superior intellect, and most seriously bent upon acquiring
a knowledge of the profession. Mr. Weasel was
not blessed with the power of formally communicating elementary
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
knowledge; Mr. Aubrey had, as it were, to <i>extort</i>
from him what he wanted, with something like a
painful effort. The real advantages of his position, were,
the innumerable practical hints and suggestions as to the
mode of dealing with miscellaneous business, which he
derived from a watchful attention to whatever passed in
chambers&mdash;to the mode, in which Weasel hunted up and
applied his law, and reduced the facts involved in litigation
into legal shape and language, in the process of
pleading. The penetrating eye of Mr. Aubrey, thus closely
fixed on everything that came under his notice, quickly
began to discover and appreciate the good sense, the practical
utility of most of the positive rules of law which he
saw in operation; and at the end of a fortnight or three
weeks, he began to feel interest in the study upon which
he had so vigorously entered, and in which he felt himself
making real progress. Mr. Weasel, during even that time,
perceived the prodigious superiority of Mr. Aubrey over
another pupil, who had nearly completed his second year
in Mr. Weasel's chambers, after a twelvemonth spent in
a conveyancer's; not, of course, in respect of legal knowledge,
but of intellectual power and aptitude for business.&mdash;Mr.
Aubrey would return to Vivian Street about six
o'clock each evening, a little fatigued with a very long
day's work, (for he was never later than five o'clock in
entering his study, in the morning;) but he was quickly
cheered and refreshed by the sight of the fond and lovely
beings whom he there rejoined, and who had been counting
the very minutes till he returned. Every day knit
that little family together, if possible, in stronger bonds
of love; for they clung to each other with a feeling of
having been thrust out of the great gay world together,
and sent, as it were, upon a pilgrimage afar, amid scenes
of increasing gloom, difficulty, and danger. Each day
that bore them farther from that of their expulsion from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
Yatton, mellowed, as it were, their recollections of past
scenes, and poured upon their wounded feelings the soothing
balm of pious resignation; and sometimes, also, faint
and trembling beams of hope concerning the future, would
steal across the gloomy chambers of their hearts. Thank
God, the view of the past presented to them no occasion
for shame, for remorse, for self-condemnation! They
trusted that, in their day of wealth and distinction, many
as had been their shortcomings, they had not been found
wilfully neglecting the duties imposed upon them. Therefore
they derived a just consolation from a view of the
past. But the <small>FUTURE</small>&mdash;indeed&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shadows, clouds, and darkness rested on it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Their hearts involuntarily fluttered and shrank within
them, when they gazed upon the threatening gloom which
hung over it. Their straitened circumstances&mdash;an honorable
poverty&mdash;had been a burden light, indeed, to bear.
They were very happy in one another's company; their
house, though small, was convenient, and even elegantly
comfortable; they had health; Mr. Aubrey had constant
exercise for an active and vigorous mind, in the acquisition
of the learning of a noble profession, the practice of
which might possibly hereafter raise all of them to even
affluence and distinction&mdash;at all events, might secure
them the substantial comforts of life. But he would have
moments of heaviness and trepidation. When engaged
in his little study, in the profound solitude and silence
of the early morning, while he was thus straining his faculties
to their utmost, on behalf of the sweet innocent
beings&mdash;his wife&mdash;his children&mdash;his sister&mdash;sleeping
above, he would sometimes lean back in his chair, with a
very deep sigh, and sink into a revery&mdash;oh, how sad and
painful!&mdash;deepening occasionally into agony; but he
would suddenly arouse himself, and resume his studies
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
with a powerful effort at abstraction&mdash;with additional
intensity of application.&mdash;How, indeed, could he be otherwise
than momentarily <i>paralyzed</i>, when he surveyed his
truly alarming, his tremendous pecuniary liabilities? Bills
of costs&mdash;Heaven only knew to what amount&mdash;due to
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap; to his own attorneys,
Messrs. Runnington; and to Mr. Parkinson: and then&mdash;sickening
and fearful object!&mdash;the Mesne Profits&mdash;what
<i>was</i> to become of them all? The mind which, in the
presence of such disturbing forces as these, could apply
its energies so successfully as did that of Mr. Aubrey to
the acquisition of knowledge, with any degree of calmness,
must surely have been of no common order, and have undergone
no slight discipline; but, alas! alas! what could
all this have availed him, unless he had been vouchsafed
assistance from on high? When the <i>waters were come in
unto his soul</i>; when he was <i>sinking in deep mire, where
there was no standing</i>; when he was <i>come into deep waters,
where the floods overflowed him</i>&mdash;whither was he to look
but to one quarter, and that <small>ABOVE</small>, with earnest, and
faithful, and constant supplication to the Almighty?</p>

<p>The constant apprehension of very great evil&mdash;<i>suspense</i>&mdash;is
a state almost as terrible and insupportable,
especially to those of lively susceptibilities, as that produced
by the infliction of the evil. Every morning when
Aubrey left home, he dreaded to think of what might happen
before his return; and when he quitted the Temple,
he experienced a sinking of the heart, when he thought
of what might have transpired in his absence. In fact,
they all of them felt like those whom the ominous silence
and repose of surrounding nature&mdash;a portentous calm
and gloom overhead&mdash;fill with trembling apprehension
of the coming storm. Their fears are quickened by the
occasional falling of large spreading drops of rain through
the sultry sky, not a breath of air stirring. Upward is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
oft turned the pale cheek and apprehensive eye towards
the black accumulating clouds, from which may soon
flame the destructive lightning&mdash;what, in such a case,
is there to rely upon, but the mercy of Him around whose
throne are clouds and darkness, and the whirlwind and
tempest His ordering?</p>

<p>The little family were sitting one morning at their
usual early and simple breakfast, and Mr. Aubrey was
reading aloud, for his wife and sister's suggestions, a
second article which he had commenced over-night, designed
for a recently-established Review&mdash;having, some
fortnight before, sent off his first effort, about which, however,
he had as yet heard nothing; and Kate was playfully
patting his cheek, and telling him that, for all he
might say to the contrary, a particular expression was
not, in her opinion, "<i>elegant English!</i>"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i>, you pert puss," insisted Aubrey, with a good-natured
laugh; and then, turning to Mrs. Aubrey, "What
do <i>you</i> say, Agnes?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;why&mdash;I really like it very much as it is."</p>

<p>"I sha'n't alter it," said Aubrey, laughing.</p>

<p>"Then I'll alter it when you're gone," quoth Kate,
jauntily, and bringing her beautiful laughing face so near
his own, with a kind of air of defiance, that he kissed her
forehead, and said it should be as she chose.</p>

<p>Just then a knock at the door announced a visitor, who
proved to be Mr. Runnington. Why it was they hardly
knew; but they all slightly changed color. He had called
so early, he said, to insure seeing Mr. Aubrey before he
went to the Temple; and, though he had been shown
into the study, Mr. Aubrey insisted on his joining the
breakfast-table.</p>

<p>"We've very plain fare for you, however," said he, as
Mr. Runnington yielded to his wishes.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey perceived, with some uneasiness, that the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
kind and thoughtful countenance of Mr. Runnington
wore rather an anxious expression. And indeed so it
was. When he looked at those who sat before him&mdash;lovely,
elegant, yet with a plainly forced cheerfulness&mdash;reflected
on the sufferings which they had passed through,
and those which were but too evidently in store for them&mdash;and
for the first bitter instalment of which he had
come to prepare Mr. Aubrey&mdash;could he but feel very
deep sympathy for them? As soon as he had retired with
Mr. Aubrey to the study, in a low tone he explained
his errand, which was to apprise him that, the evening
before, Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap's <small>BILL</small> had
come in.</p>

<p>"Well, show it me, if you please," said Mr. Aubrey,
calmly, extending his hand.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, why do you suppose I have it <i>with me</i>?"
inquired Mr. Runnington, with a concerned air. "You are
not accustomed to such matters&mdash;God forbid you should
be! It is too bulky for me to have brought with me,
and lies at our office!"</p>

<p>"What is the <i>amount</i> of it, then?" inquired Mr. Aubrey,
dreading to hear the answer; while Mr. Runnington
took out of his pocket-book a slip of paper, which he
handed to Mr. Aubrey, and on which the latter read&mdash;"£3,946,
14s. 6d." He gazed at it for some moments
in silence, and became very pale. Mr. Runnington could
hardly bear to look at him, and think of the two lovely
women in the adjoining room, who were so fearfully interested
in the intelligence which had so dismayed Mr.
Aubrey.</p>

<p>"This is a very&mdash;large&mdash;amount," said the latter at
length, with suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>"It is a most serious affair," replied Mr. Runnington,
shaking his head and sighing.</p>

<p>"Then there is yours&mdash;and Mr. Parkinson's."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Aubrey&mdash;<i>sufficient for the day is the evil
thereof</i>."</p>

<p>"Will you oblige me by saying what is the probable
amount of <i>your</i> bill?" inquired Mr. Aubrey, with a calmness
which seemed lent to him by despair.</p>

<p>"Oh! I assure you we have thought nothing at all
about it, nor shall we for some time to come, Mr. Aubrey.
We have not the slightest intention of troubling ourselves,
or you, with the matter till you may be in a position
to attend to it without serious inconvenience."</p>

<p>"But <i>do</i> favor me with something like a <i>notion</i>," pressed
the unhappy Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;perhaps I am hardly doing right in mentioning
it; but whenever our bill is sent in, it will be less by
some six hundred and fifty pounds, by the noble generosity
of the Attorney-General, who has returned all his
fees"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Returned all his fees!" echoed Mr. Aubrey, starting,
while the color rushed into his cheek, and the expression
of his countenance was of pride struggling with astonishment,
and gratitude, and admiration. He profoundly appreciated
the conduct of his distinguished friend; and at
the same time felt a <i>totally new</i> and very painful sense of
pecuniary obligation.</p>

<p>"I feel, Mr. Aubrey, that I have broken my promise to
the Attorney-General, who extracted from me a solemn
pledge, to endeavor so to manage the matter as that you
should never know it. What is it, after all&mdash;noble as
it is&mdash;to the Attorney-General, with his £12,000 or
£15,000 a-year?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;do not talk <i>so</i>, Mr. Runnington; I am overpowered,
oppressed. Never in all my life have I experienced
feelings like those by which I am now agitated!"
He rose, and stood opposite the window for a few minutes,
neither of them speaking. Then he returned to his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>"How much does that leave me your debtor?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;really it is hard to say, unprepared&mdash;I should
imagine&mdash;if you will really force me to speak of such an
unpleasant topic&mdash;that our account is reduced to some
£1,500 or £1,600&mdash;about which"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then there is Mr. Parkinson's," said Aubrey, in a low
tone, but with a desperate air; presently adding&mdash;"Here
are some £6,000 or £7,000 to start with; and <i>then</i> we
come to the mesne profits&mdash;gracious, gracious God!" he
suddenly added with a visible shudder. He folded his
arms convulsively, and gazed, for a second or two, at
Mr. Runnington, with an eye, the expression of which
was overpowering. In his face Mr. Runnington beheld no
longer the melancholy mildness to which he had been accustomed,
but a sternness and power were apparent in his
features, which Mr. Runnington had not imagined them
capable of exhibiting. They told of a strong soul thoroughly
roused, and excited, and in agony. At that moment
a knocking was heard at the door, as of very little
fingers. "Come in!" exclaimed Mr. Aubrey, with unusual
quickness and sternness. He was obeyed&mdash;and
Charles's little face peeped into the room timidly. He
was evidently quite startled by the tone in which he had
been addressed. "Come in, my child!" said Mr. Aubrey,
rather tremulously, when he saw that it was <i>his son</i>, and
observed the apprehensiveness overspreading his little
features. Charles immediately advanced, with a serious
submissive air, saying&mdash;"This letter is just come&mdash;Mamma
sent me with it, dear papa"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give it me, Charles," said Mr. Aubrey, extending his
hand for it, while with the other he gently placed the child
upon his lap, and kissed him. "I'm not angry with you,
Charles," said he, tenderly.</p>

<p>"I've not been naughty, you know, dear papa!" said
he, with innocent surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, my little love." The ruined <small>FATHER</small> could
say no more; but putting aside the child's flowing curly
locks from his temples, as it were mechanically, he gazed
on his little face for a moment, and then folded him in
his arms with unspeakable tenderness. Mr. Runnington
rose, and stood for some moments gazing through the window,
unwilling that his own emotion should be observed.
When Mr. Aubrey opened the letter, it proved to be from
the publisher of the Review to which he had sent his article,
enclosing a check for forty guineas, expressing an earnest
desire that he would continue his contributions, and assuring
him that the editor considered the article "in every
way admirable." As soon as he had glanced over the letter&mdash;"You
little messenger of hope and mercy!" he thought,
again kissing his son, who sat passively gazing at the agitated
countenance of his <small>FATHER</small>&mdash;"I cannot, I will not
despair! You have brought me, as it were, a ray of light
from heaven, piercing the fearful gloom of my situation;
'tis a token, surely, that I am not forgotten: I feel as
though an angel, momentarily brightening the night of
sorrow, had come and whispered in my ear&mdash;'<small>COURAGE!</small>'"
His features began to resume their natural serenity of expression.
"Take it in to your mamma," said he, kissing
little Charles, and despatching him with the letter.
Shortly afterwards, as soon as he had recovered the command
of his manner sufficiently to avoid occasioning uneasiness
to Mrs. and Miss Aubrey, he proposed to Mr.
Runnington that they should walk towards the Temple;
and bidding adieu to those whom he left behind him, without
giving them an opportunity to ask him as to the nature
of Mr. Runnington's errand, but leaving them in high
spirits at the letter which he had sent in to them, he
quitted the house arm-in-arm with Mr. Runnington. I
am persuaded that if that gentleman had had no one to
consult, he would, serious as was the amount of his claim,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
have relieved Mr. Aubrey altogether from liability to <i>him</i>;
but he had four partners; their own pecuniary outlay had
been considerable; the thing, therefore, was practically
quite out of the question. As they walked along, in the
course of much anxious conversation, Mr. Runnington told
Mr. Aubrey that he considered Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap's bill to be most outrageous and profligate in its
charges; and that it might, on taxation&mdash;a process which
he explained to Mr. Aubrey&mdash;be reduced, probably, by
at least <i>one-half</i>. But he also reminded Mr. Aubrey of
the power which they held in their hands, in respect of
the mesne profits; and intimated his opinion, that in all
probability they had constructed their account with an
eye to such considerations&mdash;namely, that it should be
discharged without rigorous scrutiny into its constituent
items, before they would listen to any proposed terms for
the payment of the mesne profits; and that Mr. Aubrey's
position, with respect to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap, was one requiring the greatest possible deliberation
and circumspection on his part, especially in the
matter of the bill which had just been delivered in by
them.</p>

<p>"I see! The whole," said Mr. Aubrey, "comes to
this: they will relieve me from liability to Mr. Titmouse,
for as much of what may be due to him, as
they can divert into their own pockets!"</p>

<p>"That certainly seems very much like it," replied Mr.
Runnington, shrugging his shoulders; "but you will leave
all such considerations and matters to us; and rely on
our vigilance and discretion. At what may appear to us
the exact moment for doing so with effect, depend upon
our most cautious interference. We know, Mr. Aubrey,
the kind of people we have to deal with. Mr. Titmouse
is very likely to be merely a puppet in their hands&mdash;at
least in those of Mr. Gammon, who is a very long-headed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
man; and with him, I have no doubt, our negotiations
will have to be carried on."</p>

<p>"That is just what the Attorney-General said&mdash;and
he invited me, moreover, to converse with him whenever
I might consider that his advice would be useful."</p>

<p>"Could you have a better adviser? He has a most
penetrating sagacity, long exercised&mdash;in short, his qualifications
are consummate; and I should not hesitate about
consulting him in a friendly way, whenever we feel at a
loss."</p>

<p>"Why should I disguise anything from you, Mr. Runnington?"&mdash;said
Aubrey&mdash;"you ought to know the exact
state of my affairs. I have a little family plate, which
I could not bear to part with; my books; and the remnants
of the furniture at Yatton, which I have saved in
order to furnish our present residence. Besides this, the
outside of all that I am possessed of&mdash;and I have no expectations,
nor has my wife nor my poor sister, from any
quarter&mdash;is a sum of about £3,000 in the funds, and £423
at my banker's. Those are my circumstances; they appall
me merely in stating them:&mdash;Why, I owe double the sum
I have named, for lawyers' bills only. I have not enough,
without parting with my books and plate, to discharge
even Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap's bill!"</p>

<p>"It would be cruel and absurd in me not to express at
once, Mr. Aubrey, my conviction that your situation is
fearfully critical; and that your sole hope is in the moderation
which may be hoped for from Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap, and their client, Mr. Titmouse. Serious
as are, at present, your other liabilities&mdash;to that one, of
the mesne profits, they are but as a bucket of water to
the Thames. As we are talking, Mr. Aubrey, in this candid
and unrestrained manner, I will tell you my chief
source of apprehension on your account, with reference
to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap: namely, that they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
may possibly speculate on your being able, if placed in
real peril, to call around you, in your extremity, a host
of wealthy and powerful friends&mdash;as security, or otherwise"&mdash;</p>

<p>"They will find themselves, then, utterly mistaken,"
said Mr. Aubrey, sternly. "If they and their client are
really capable of such shocking brutality&mdash;such wanton
oppression&mdash;let them do their worst: I am resigned.
Providence will discover a shelter for my poor wife and
children, and my dear, devoted, high-spirited sister; and as
for myself, rather than satiate the rapacity of such wretches,
by plundering good-natured and generous friends, I will
spend the remainder of my days in prison!"</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey was evidently not a little excited while he
said this; but there was that in his tone of voice, and in his
eye, which told Mr. Runnington that he meant what he
said; and that, as soon as it should have come to the point
of oppression and injustice, no man could resist more powerfully,
or endure with a more dignified and inflexible resolution.
But Mr. Runnington expressed strong hopes that
it would not come to such an issue. He consoled Mr.
Aubrey with assurances that, as for their own demand,
it might stand over for years; and that so, he was sure,
would it be with the far lesser demand of Mr. Parkinson;
and that if, by a great effort, sufficient could be raised to
discharge promptly the bill of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap, some much more favorable arrangement respecting
the amount and mode of payment of the mesne profits
might be effected&mdash;leaving Mr. Aubrey, in the mean
time, leisure to apply himself vigorously to his studies for
the bar, for which Mr. Runnington assured him that he
considered him peculiarly qualified; and pledged himself
to back him with all the influence he had, or could
command.</p>

<p>"Gracious Heaven, Mr. Runnington!" said Aubrey,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
with a little excitement, "is it not very nearly intolerable
that I should pass the prime of my days in thraldom
to such people as these, and be encircled by the chains
of such a man as this Titmouse is represented as being?
I will not call myself his foe, nor his victim; but I am
the one through whose sudden destitution he has obtained
a splendid fortune. I did not <i>knowingly</i> deprive him of
it&mdash;he must be bereft of all the ordinary feelings of humanity,
to place me, whom he has already stripped of all,
upon the rack&mdash;the rack of extortion! Oh! put me in
his place, and him in mine&mdash;do you think I would not
have been satisfied with what I had gained? Would <i>I</i>
have alarmed and tortured him by calling for an account
of what he had spent with a firm, a reasonable persuasion
that it was his own&mdash;profoundly unconscious of its being
another's? Oh, no! I would not only have forgiven him
all, but endeavored to secure him from future want!"
He sighed. "Oh, that I were at this moment a free
man! <i>pauper&mdash;sed in meo &aelig;re</i>; that I had but five
hundred pounds to keep me and mine for a year or
two&mdash;with a mind at ease, and fit for study! but here
we are at the Temple. When shall we meet again&mdash;or
shall I hear from you?"</p>

<p>"Very shortly," replied Mr. Runnington, who for the
last few minutes had been listening to Mr. Aubrey in
respectful and sympathizing silence; and shaking him
warmly by the hand, with much cordiality and fervency
of manner, he pledged himself to do all in his power to
promote his interests.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>When Mr. Aubrey arrived at Mr. Weasel's chambers, he
looked dejected and harassed; yet, exerting his powers
of self-command, he at once addressed himself, calmly and
vigorously, to the business of the day. From time to
time he peremptorily excluded the distressing thoughts
and recollections arising out of his morning's interview
with Mr. Runnington; and succeeded in concentrating
his attention upon a case of more than usual intricacy
and multifariousness of details, which Mr. Weasel, having
glanced over, had laid aside for a more leisurely perusal.
He handed it, however, to Mr. Aubrey soon after his
arrival, with something approaching to a secret satisfaction,
in the expectation of its "proving too much for
him;" but he was mistaken. Mr. Aubrey left a little
earlier than usual; but not before he had sent in the
voluminous "case" to Mr. Weasel's room by the clerk,
together with a half-sheet of draft paper, containing a
brief summary of the results at which he had arrived;
and which not a little surprised Mr. Weasel. The case
did not happen to involve much technical knowledge;
but, as well in respect of the imperfect manner in which
it was drawn up, as of the confusion worse confounded
of the transactions themselves, out of which the questions
arose, there were required persevering attention,
strength of memory, and great clear-headedness. In
short, Weasel owned to himself that Mr. Aubrey had
taken a very masterly view of the case; and how would
his estimate of his pupil's ability have been enhanced,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
by a knowledge of the situation in which he was placed&mdash;one
so calculated to distract his attention, and prevent
that hearty and complete devotion to legal studies, without
which Mr. Weasel well knew how vain was the attempt
to master them?</p>

<p>"Have you read Aubrey's opinion on that troublesome
case&mdash;I mean the Cornish Bank?" inquired Weasel,
taking a pinch of snuff, of Mr. Thoroughpace, another
pupil who had just sat down beside Mr. Weasel, to see
him "settle" [<i>i. e.</i> score out, interline, and alter] a pleading
drawn by the aforesaid Thoroughpace. That gentleman
replied in the negative. "He's got a headpiece of
his own, I can tell you!&mdash;-Egad, somehow or another, he
always contrives to hit the nail on the head!"</p>

<p>"I'd a sort of notion, the very first day he came, that
he was a superior man," replied Thoroughpace. "He
makes very few notes&mdash;seems to trust entirely to his
head"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! a man may carry that too far," interrupted Mr.
Weasel, thrusting a pinch of snuff up his nose.</p>

<p>"Then I wish <i>I</i> could," replied Thoroughpace. "Isn't
there such a thing as making <i>the hand engross the business
of the head</i>?" Mr. Weasel&mdash;recollecting that in his library
stood twelve thick folio volumes of manuscript "precedents,"
which he had been fool enough to copy out with
his own hand during his pupilage, and the first year or
two of his setting up in business&mdash;hemmed, and again
applied to his snuff-box. "How do you get on with
Aubrey in the pupils' room?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't like him at first. Very reserved, and
is not without <i>hauteur</i>. Even now, though very courteous,
he says little, appears entirely absorbed by his
studies; and yet he seems to have something or other
pressing on his mind."</p>

<p>"Ah! I dare say! Law's no trifle, I warrant him!
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
No doubt it's <i>teasing</i> him!" replied Weasel, rather
complacently.</p>

<p>"Do you know I should doubt it! I never saw a man
to whom it seemed to <i>yield</i> so easily.&mdash;He's a particularly
<i>gentlemanlike</i> person, by the way; and there's
something very attractive in his countenance. He seems
highly connected."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;why, you've heard of the great cause of <i>Doe</i> d.
<i>Titmouse</i> v. <i>Jolter</i>, a Yorkshire ejectment case, tried only
last spring assizes?&mdash;That case, you know, about the effect
of an <i>erasure</i>.&mdash;Well, he's the defendant, and has, I
hear, lost everything."</p>

<p>"You astonish me! By Jove, then, he had need
work!"</p>

<p>"Shall <i>we</i> set to work, Mr. Thoroughpace?" said Weasel,
suddenly, looking at his watch lying on his desk. "I've
promised to let them have these pleas by six o'clock&mdash;or
the other side will be signing judgment;" and plunging
his pen into the inkstand, to work he went, <i>more suo</i>, as if
such a man as his pupil, Mr. Aubrey, had never existed.
Weasel was not at all a hard-hearted man; but I verily
believe that if a <i>capias ad satisfaciendum</i> (<i>i. e.</i> final process
to take the body into custody to satisfy debt and
costs) against Charles Aubrey, Esquire, had come into
Mr. Weasel's chambers to be "<i>settled</i>" as requiring special
accuracy&mdash;after humming and hawing a bit&mdash;and
taking an extra pinch of snuff, he would have done his
duty by the document faithfully, marked his <i>seven-and-sixpence</i>
in the corner, and sent it out indifferently with
other papers; consoling himself with this just reflection,
that the thing <i>must</i> be done by <i>somebody!</i> and he might
as well have the <i>fee</i> as any one else!</p>

<p>On Mr. Aubrey's return home to dinner, he found that
his sister had received another long letter from Dr. Tatham,
to which was appended a postscript mentioning Mr.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Gammon in such terms as suggested to Mr. Aubrey a little
scheme which he resolved to carry into effect on the
morrow&mdash;namely, to call himself at the office of Messrs.
Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, and seek an interview with
Mr. Gammon, who, Dr. Tatham stated, had quitted Yatton
for town only the day before the doctor had written
to Miss Aubrey. After a very restless and unhappy
night, during which he was tormented by all kinds of dismal
dreams, Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap figuring
in each as the stern and mysterious arbiters of his earthly
destiny, he resolved to put an end to his present insupportable
suspense&mdash;to learn at once the extent of what
he had either to hope or to fear&mdash;by calling that very
afternoon at Saffron Hill. For that purpose, he quitted
Mr. Weasel's at the early hour of three o'clock; and
straightway bent his steps towards those delectable localities&mdash;through
Fetter Lane to Hatton Garden, thence
inquiring his way to Saffron Hill. He was not long in
finding the house of which he was in quest, his eye being
soon attracted by the great, gleaming brass-plate with
the words "<span class="smcap">Quirk</span>, <span class="smcap">Gammon</span>, and <span class="smcap">Snap</span>," as prominent and
threatening as ever those names had appeared to Titmouse
in the day of <i>his</i> agony and suspense. <i>He</i> had stood gazing
at them with idiot longing and vulgar apprehension, as
the reader has seen. How very different a person now
looked at them with feelings of intense interest and overmastering
anxiety, as at the names of those who had him
completely in their power&mdash;his fortunes, his <i>liberty</i>, his
livelihood, and that of the dear beings whose interests,
whose all on earth, whose personal safety&mdash;were bound up
in his! Mr. Aubrey, with a jaded air, dressed in a buttoned
black surtout, and with an umbrella under his arm, entered
the hall, where were sitting and standing several
strange-looking people&mdash;one or two suffering evidently
great agitation; in fact, relatives of prisoners whose trials
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
for capital offences were coming on the next day at Newgate&mdash;and
made his way into a room, on the door of
which he read "Clerks' Room."</p>

<p>"Now, sir, your name and business?" said a showily
dressed Jewish-looking youth, with copious curls, lolling
at a desk from which he did not move, and speaking in
a tone of very disagreeable assurance.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Gammon within? my name is Aubrey," he
added, taking off his hat; and there was a certain <i>something</i>
in his voice, countenance, and bearing&mdash;a certain
courtly superiority&mdash;which induced the personage whom
he had addressed to slip off his stool, and exhibit as polite
an air as <i>he</i> could possibly assume.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gammon is in his room, sir, and alone. I believe
he is rather busy," said the youth, going towards
Mr. Gammon's room&mdash;"but I've no doubt you can see
him."</p>

<p>The fact was, that at that very moment Mr. Gammon
was engaged drawing up "Instructions to prepare Declaration"
in an action for mesne profits against Mr. Aubrey!
He had only the day before returned from Yatton,
where circumstances had occurred which had quickened
their intended proceeding against that unfortunate gentleman&mdash;that
being the first quarter to which, at Mr.
Titmouse's suggestion, they were to look for a considerable
supply of ready money. That morning, in the very
room into which Mr. Aubrey was to be presently shown,
had taken place a long discussion between Mr. Quirk and
Mr. Gammon, on the very subject which had now brought
to their office Mr. Aubrey. Mr. Quirk was for making
short work of it&mdash;for "going straight a-head"&mdash;and getting
the whole £60,000 or security for the greater portion,
and £20,000 down! Gammon, however, was of opinion
that that was mere madness; that by attempting to proceed
to extremities against so unfortunate a sufferer as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Mr. Aubrey, they could not fail of drawing down on themselves
and their client universal execration&mdash;(at <i>that</i>,
Quirk only grunted and grinned;) and, moreover, of
driving Mr. Aubrey desperate, and forcing him either to
quit the country, or accept the protection of the insolvent
laws&mdash;at this Mr. Quirk looked serious enough. Gammon
had, in the end, satisfied his senior partner that their
only chance was in gentleness and moderation; and the
old gentleman had, as usual, agreed to adopt the plan of
operations suggested by Gammon. The latter personage
had quite as keen a desire and firm determination as the
former, to wring out of their wretched victim the very
last farthing which there was the slightest probability of
obtaining; for Titmouse had pointed to that quarter for
the discharge of his ten thousand pound bond, and bill of
costs (which&mdash;by the way&mdash;contained some three hundred
items, slightly varied in language, which stood also
charged in their bill to Mr. Aubrey!) then twenty&mdash;or
at least fifteen thousand pounds, were to be handed over
to himself, Titmouse; and all the rest that could be got,
Mr. Gammon might appropriate to his own use. Such
was the prospective partition of the spoil!&mdash;Mr. Gammon's
inquiries into Mr. Aubrey's circumstances, had completely
convinced him, however, that it would be impossible
to extract any considerable sum from that unfortunate gentleman;
and that if they could contrive to get payment of
their bill against him&mdash;perhaps substantial security for
a portion&mdash;say four or five thousand pounds&mdash;of the
mesne profits; and his own personal responsibility for
the payment of any portion of the remainder, hereafter&mdash;they
had better rest satisfied&mdash;and look for liquidation
of their own heavy claim, to a mortgage upon the
Yatton estates. Mr. Gammon had also proposed to himself
certain other objects, in dealing with Mr. Aubrey,
than the mere extraction of money from him; and, in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
short, prompted by considerations such as those above
intimated, he had come to the determination, an hour
or so before Mr. Aubrey's most unexpected visit, to be
at once prepared with the necessary means for setting in
motion legal proceedings for the recovery of the arrear of
mesne profits. But we are keeping Mr. Aubrey waiting,
all this while, in the outer office.</p>

<p>"Have I the honor to address Mr. Gammon?" commenced
Mr. Aubrey, courteously, on being shown into the
room&mdash;not announced by name, but only as "<i>a gentleman</i>"&mdash;where
Gammon sat busily engaged writing out
the "Instructions" for framing the rack on which it was
designed to extend his unconscious visitor!</p>

<p>"Sir, my name <i>is</i> Gammon," he replied, coloring a little&mdash;and
rising, with an expression of very great surprise&mdash;"I
believe I have the honor of seeing Mr. Aubrey?&mdash;I
beg you will allow me to offer you a chair"&mdash;he continued
with forced calmness of manner, placing one as
far distant as was possible from the table, and, to make
assurance doubly sure, seating himself between Mr. Aubrey
and the table; expecting to hear his visitor at once
open the subject of their bill, which they had so recently
sent in.</p>

<p>"Will you suffer me, Mr. Aubrey," commenced Gammon,
with a bland and subdued air, not fulsome, but extremely
deferential, "before entering on any business
which may have brought you here, to express deep and
sincere sympathy with your sufferings, and my <i>personal</i>
regret at the share we have had in the proceedings
which have ended so adversely for your interests? But
our duty as professional men, Mr. Aubrey, is often as
plain as painful!"</p>

<p>"I feel obliged, sir," said Mr. Aubrey, with a sigh, "for
your kind expressions of sympathy&mdash;but I cannot for a
moment conceive any apology necessary. Neither I, nor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
my advisers, that I am aware of, have ever had cause to
complain of harsh or unprofessional treatment on your
part. Your proceedings certainly came upon me&mdash;upon
all of us&mdash;like a thunder-stroke," said Mr. Aubrey, with
a little emotion. "I trust that you have given me credit,
Mr. Gammon, for offering no vexatious or unconscientious
obstacles."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Aubrey! on the contrary, I am at a loss for
words to express my sense of your straightforward and
high-minded conduct; and have several times intimated
my sentiments on that subject to Messrs. Runnington"&mdash;Mr.
Aubrey bowed&mdash;"and again I anxiously beg that
you will give me credit for feeling the profoundest sympathy"&mdash;he
paused, as if from emotion; and such might
well have been excited, in any person of ordinary feeling,
by the appearance of Mr. Aubrey&mdash;calm and melancholy&mdash;his
features full of anxiety and exhaustion,
and his figure, naturally slender, evidently somewhat
emaciated.</p>

<p>["I wonder," thought Gammon, "whether he has any
<i>insurances on his life</i>!&mdash;He certainly has <i>rather</i> a consumptive
look&mdash;I should like to ascertain the fact&mdash;and
in what office&mdash;and to what extent."]</p>

<p>"I trust, most sincerely, Mr. Aubrey, that the mental
sufferings which you must have undergone, have not
affected your health?" inquired Gammon, with an air of
infinite concern.</p>

<p>"A little, certainly, sir, but, thank God, I believe not
materially; I never was very robust," he replied with a
faint sad smile.</p>

<p>["<i>How like his sister!</i>"&mdash;thought Gammon, watching
his companion's countenance with real interest.]</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure, Mr. Gammon," continued Aubrey,
"that I am observing etiquette in thus coming to
you, on a matter which you may consider ought to have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
been left to my solicitors, and who know nothing of my
present visit&mdash;but"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"An honorable mind like yours, Mr. Aubrey, may
surely act according to its own impulses with safety!
As for etiquette, I know of no professional rule which I
break, in entering into a discussion with you of any topic
connected with the action which has recently been determined,"
said Gammon, cautiously, and particularly on his
guard, as soon as his penetrating eye had detected the
acuteness which was mingled with the sincerity and simplicity
of character visible in the oppressed countenance
of Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"I dare say you can guess the occasion of my visit, Mr.
Gammon?"</p>

<p>["There goes <i>our bill</i>!&mdash;Whew!&mdash;What now?"
thought Gammon.]</p>

<p>Mr. Gammon bowed, with an anxious, expectant air.</p>

<p>"I allude to the question yet remaining between your
client, Mr. Titmouse, and me&mdash;the mesne profits"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feared&mdash;I expected as much! It gave me infinite
anxiety, as soon as I found you were approaching the
subject!"</p>

<p>"To me it is really a matter of life and death, Mr.
Gammon. It is one pressing me on, almost to the very
verge of despair!"</p>

<p>"Do not, Mr. Aubrey," said Gammon, in a tone and
with a look which touched the heart of his agitated companion,
"magnify the mischief. Don't&mdash;I beg&mdash;imagine
your position to be one so hopeless! What is there
to stand in the way of an amicable adjustment of these
claims? If I had my way, Mr. Aubrey&mdash;and if I thought
I should not be acting the part of the unjust steward in
Scripture&mdash;I would write sixty thousand farthings for
sixty thousand pounds!"</p>

<p>"You have named the sum for which I believe I am
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
legally liable to Mr. Titmouse," said Mr. Aubrey, with
forced composure; "it is, however, a sum as completely
out of my power to pay or secure&mdash;or even a quarter of
it&mdash;as to give him one of the stars."</p>

<p>"I am aware, Mr. Aubrey, that you must have had
many calls upon you, which must have temporarily crippled
your resources"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Temporarily!" echoed Mr. Aubrey, with a sickening
smile.</p>

<p>"I devoutly trust that it <i>is</i> only temporary! For your
own and family's sake," he added quickly, observing the
watchfulness with which his every look and word was
regarded by his companion. "Any proposal, Mr. Aubrey,"
he continued with the same apparent kindness of
manner, but with serious deliberation, "which you may
think proper to make, I am ready&mdash;eager&mdash;to receive
and consider in a liberal spirit. I repeat&mdash;If I, only,
had to be consulted&mdash;you would leave this room with a
lightened heart; but to be plain and candid, our client,
Mr. Titmouse, is a very difficult person to deal with! I
pledge my word of honor to you&mdash;[<i>Oh Gammon! Gammon!
Gammon!</i>]&mdash;that I have repeatedly urged upon
Mr. Titmouse to release you from all the rents which had
been received by you previously to your having legal
notice of the late proceedings." I suppose Gammon felt
that this declaration was not received as implicitly as he
desired, and had expected; for with a slight stiffness, he
added, "I assure you, sir, that it is a fact. I have always
been of opinion that the law is harsh, and even
faulty in principle, which, in such a case as yours&mdash;where
the possessor of an estate, to which he believed himself
born, is ousted by a title of which he had no previous
knowledge, nor <small>MEANS</small> of knowledge"&mdash;Gammon uttered
this very pointedly, and with his eye fixed searchingly
upon that of Mr. Aubrey&mdash;"requires him to make good
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the rents which he had so innocently appropriated to his
own use. That is my <i>opinion</i>, though it may be wrong.
I am bound to say, however, that as the law now stands&mdash;if
Mr. Titmouse should, contrary to my advice, determine
to stand upon his strict rights"&mdash;&mdash;Gammon
paused, shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and
looked with melancholy significance at Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"I am entirely at his mercy! that I perfectly understand.
I do trust, however, that in the name of our
common humanity he will have some consideration for
the helpless&mdash;the miserable situation in which I am
so unexpectedly placed," said Aubrey, with mournful
energy. "Never having imagined it necessary to save
money"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;nor, with such an income as yours was, to
resort, I fear, to any of the ordinary modes of providing
against emergencies&mdash;by <i>insurance</i> of your life, for instance"&mdash;interposed
Gammon, sighing.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;sir! nothing of the sort"&mdash;["Ah!&mdash;the
deuce you have not!" thought Gammon]&mdash;"and I confess&mdash;I
now bitterly feel&mdash;how improvident I have
been! My situation is so deplorable and desperate, that
disguise would be absurd, even could I stoop to it; and
I declare, in the presence of Heaven, Mr. Gammon, that
without giving up the little remnant of plate I have preserved,
and my books, I am unable to liquidate even the
amount of your bill sent in the day before yesterday"&mdash;Gammon
gazed at Aubrey mournfully, but in silence&mdash;"and
if my miserable remnant of means <i>be</i> so appropriated,
we are <i>literally beggars</i>"&mdash;he paused, and his voice
faltered.</p>

<p>"Indeed&mdash;indeed, you distress me beyond measure,
Mr. Aubrey," said Gammon, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"If you can but secure me, sir&mdash;and that is the object
of this intrusion upon you&mdash;a merciful interval, to prepare
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
myself for the profession which I have entered&mdash;the
bar&mdash;whatever earnings I might obtain, after leaving
a bare maintenance for myself and family, shall be
devoted faithfully to liquidate the heavy claims upon me!
For myself, Mr. Gammon, I do not care about living upon
bread and water for the next ten years; but there are
others"&mdash;his voice trembled. "Sir," he suddenly added
with almost passionate energy, "by every consideration
which can influence a gentleman, I conjure you to interfere
between me and utter immediate ruin!"</p>

<p>This was the real thrilling language of the heart; but it
failed to produce the least impression upon Gammon, in
whom it excited only intense chagrin and disappointment.
"Oh, that it were but in my power," said he, however, with
great energy, "to send you out of this room a free man!
If I alone were to be consulted," he continued with vivacity,
"I would instantly absolve you from all demands&mdash;or
at least give you your own time, and take no other
security than your word and honor!"</p>

<p>"Oh! what a happy&mdash;happy man! what a happy
family should we be if only"&mdash;&mdash;he could not finish the
sentence, for he was greatly moved.</p>

<p>["Here's an infernal business!" thought Gammon to
himself, and, bending down his head, he covered his eyes
with his hands;&mdash;"worse, far worse than I had suspected.
I would take five pounds for all <i>my</i> residuary interest in
the sixty thousand pounds!! I've not the least doubt
that he's speaking the truth. But the <i>bill</i> part of the
business is highly unsatisfactory! I should like my friend
Quirk to be here just now! Surely, however, Mr. Aubrey
must be able to get security? With such friends
and connections as his!&mdash;If one could only get one or
two of them to join him in a bond for ten thousand
pounds&mdash;stay&mdash;that won't exactly do either&mdash;by the
way&mdash;I <i>must</i> have my thumb upon him!"]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am so profoundly affected by the situation in which
you are placed, Mr. Aubrey," said Gammon, at length
appearing to have subdued his emotion, and feeling it
necessary to say something, "that I think I may take
upon myself to say the instructions which we have received
<i>shall not</i> be acted upon, come what may. Those
must be really monsters, not men, Mr. Aubrey, who could
press upon one in your position; and that such should
be attempted by one who has succeeded to your former
splendid advantages, is inconceivably shocking. Mr. Aubrey,
<i>you shall not be crushed</i>&mdash;indeed you shall not, so
long as I am a member&mdash;possibly not the least influential
one&mdash;of this firm, and have any weight with your
formidable creditor, Mr. Titmouse. I cannot do justice
to my desire to shelter you and yours, Mr. Aubrey, from
the storm you dread so justly!" There was a warmth,
an energy in Gammon's manner, while saying all this,
which cheered the drooping heart of his wretched visitor.
"What I am about to say, Mr. Aubrey, is in complete
confidence," continued Gammon, in a low tone. Mr. Aubrey
bowed, with a little anxious excitement in his
manner. "May I rely implicitly upon your honor and
secrecy?"</p>

<p>"Most implicitly, sir. What you desire me to keep
within my own breast, no one upon earth shall know
from <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"There are serious difficulties in the way of serving
you. Mr. Titmouse is a weak and inexperienced young
man, naturally excited to a great pitch by his present
elevation, and already embarrassed for want of ready
money. You may imagine, sir, that his liabilities to us
are of considerable magnitude. You would hardly credit,
Mr. Aubrey, the amount of mere money out of pocket
for which he stands indebted to us; our outlay during
the last two years having considerably crippled our own
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
pecuniary resources in an extensive practice like ours,
and driven us to incur responsibilities which are beginning
to occasion us personally considerable anxiety. Of
course, Mr. Aubrey, we must look to Mr. Titmouse to be
speedily reimbursed: he insists upon our immediately
calling upon you; and I have reason to suspect that he
has at his elbow one or two very heartless advisers, who
have suggested this to him; for he follows it most pertinaciously.
That he cannot meet the liabilities I have
alluded to out of his annual income, without swallowing
it up entirely for eighteen months or two years, is certain.
I regret to say that Mr. Quirk and Mr. Snap encourage
his disposition to press you;&mdash;do not be alarmed,
my dear sir!" he continued, observing the deadly paleness
of Mr. Aubrey, whose eye was riveted upon that of
Gammon; "for I declare that <i>I will</i> stand between you
and them; and it is enough for me to say, moreover, that
I have the <i>power</i> of doing so. I am&mdash;but this is committed
specially and sacredly to your confidence&mdash;<i>the
only person living who happens to possess the means of controlling
Mr. Titmouse</i>; and since you have entered this
room, I have resolved to <i>exercise</i> my powers. Now,
bearing in mind that I have no legal authority from
him, and am, at the same time, only one of a firm,
and assuring you that I am entailing a serious personal
responsibility upon myself in what I am doing, let me
throw out for your consideration my general notion of
what I think ought to be done&mdash;merely my off-hand
notion."</p>

<p>"I perfectly understand you, sir&mdash;and am penetrated
by a sense of gratitude! I listen to you with inexpressible
anxiety," said Mr. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Had I been consulted," continued Mr. Gammon, "we
should have proposed to you, with reference to our bill,
(which I frankly acknowledge contains a much more
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
liberal entry than would probably be allowed on taxation,
but with equal truth I declare that it is none of <i>my</i>
doing,")&mdash;Gammon knew the credit for candor which
this acknowledgment of a fact, of which Messrs. Runnington
would quickly apprise Mr. Aubrey after examining
the bill, was likely to obtain for him with Mr. Aubrey&mdash;"I
say, I should have <i>proposed</i> to you, in the first instance,
the payment of our bill by easy instalments, during
the next three or four years, provided you could have
obtained partial security. But I am only one of three,
and I know the determination of Mr. Quirk and Mr. Snap,
not to listen to any proposal with reference to the mesne
profits which is not based upon&mdash;in short, they say, <i>the
bill must be paid at once without being looked into</i>&mdash;I
mean," he added quickly, "without its being subjected
to the harassing and protracted scrutiny which a distrustful,
an ungrateful client, or unreasonable opponent,
has it too frequently in his power to inflict. Oh, let me
disguise nothing from you, my dear sir, in a conversation
of this kind between two gentlemen!" continued
Gammon, with an admirable air of frankness, for he perceived
that Mr. Aubrey looked slightly staggered. "I
am ashamed to acknowledge that our bill does contain
exorbitant entries&mdash;entries which have led to very frequent
and fierce disputes between me and my partners.
But <i>what is to be done</i>? Mr. Quirk is&mdash;to be completely
candid with you&mdash;the moneyed man of the firm; and if
you were but to glance at the articles of our partnership"&mdash;Gammon
shrugged his shoulders and sighed&mdash;"you
would see the tyrannical extent of power over us
which he has thereby secured! You observe how candid
I am&mdash;perhaps foolishly so."</p>

<p>["I've not quite mastered him&mdash;I can tell it by his
eye"&mdash;thought Gammon&mdash;"is this a game of chess between
us? I wonder whether, after all, Messrs. Runnington
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
are aware of his being here&mdash;knowing and trusting to
his ability&mdash;and have put him thoroughly on his guard?
He is checking strong feelings incessantly, and evidently
weighing every word I utter. Misery has sharpened
faculties naturally acute."]</p>

<p>"Pray do not say so, Mr. Gammon, I fully appreciate
your motives. I am devoured with anxiety for an intimation
of the nature of the terms which you were about, so
kindly, to specify."</p>

<p>"<i>Specify</i>, Mr. Aubrey, is perhaps rather too strong a
term&mdash;but to proceed. Supposing the preliminary matter
which I have alluded to satisfactorily arranged, I am
disposed to say, that if you could find security for the payment
of the sum of ten thousand pounds within a year, or
a year and a half"&mdash;[Mr. Aubrey's teeth almost chattered
at the mention of it]&mdash;"I&mdash;I&mdash;that is, <i>my</i> impression
is&mdash;but&mdash;I repeat&mdash;it is only <i>mine</i>"&mdash;added Gammon,
earnestly&mdash;"that the rest should be left to your
own honor, giving at the same time a personal undertaking
to pay at a future&mdash;a very distant day&mdash;in the manner
most convenient to yourself&mdash;the sum of ten thousand
pounds more&mdash;making in all only one-third of the sum
due from you; and receiving an absolute release from Mr.
Titmouse in respect of the remaining two-thirds, namely,
forty thousand pounds."</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey listened to all this with his feelings and
faculties strung to the utmost pitch of intensity; and
when Gammon had ceased, experienced a transient sense,
as if the fearful mountain which had pressed so long on
his heart were moving.</p>

<p>"Have I made myself intelligible, Mr. Aubrey?" inquired
Gammon, kindly, but very gravely.</p>

<p>"Perfectly&mdash;but I feel so oppressed and overwhelmed
with the magnitude of the topics we are discussing, that
I scarcely at present appreciate the position in which you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
would place me. I must throw myself, Mr. Gammon, entirely
upon your indulgence!"</p>

<p>Gammon looked a little disappointed.</p>

<p>"I can imagine your feelings, sir," said he, as, thrusting
into a heap the papers lying on the table, he threw
them into a drawer, and then took a sheet of paper and a
pencil; and while he made a few memoranda of the arrangement
which he had been mentioning, he continued&mdash;"You
see&mdash;the grand result of what I have been hastily
sketching off is&mdash;to give you ample time to pay the
amount which I have named, and to relieve you, at once,
<i>absolutely</i> from no less a sum than <span class="smcap">Forty Thousand
Pounds</span>," said he, with emphasis and deliberation, "for
which&mdash;and with interest&mdash;you will otherwise remain
liable to the day of your death;&mdash;there can be no escape,"
he continued with pointed significance of manner&mdash;"except,
perhaps, into banishment, which, with your
feelings, would be worse than death&mdash;for it would&mdash;of
course&mdash;be a <i>dishonorable</i> exile&mdash;to avoid just liabilities;&mdash;and
those who bear your name would, in such
an"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, sir, be silent!" exclaimed Mr. Aubrey, in a tone
and manner which electrified Gammon, who started in his
chair. Mr. Aubrey's face was whitened; his eye glanced
lightning at his companion. Dagon-like, Gammon had
put forth his hand and touched the ark of Aubrey's honor.
Gammon lost his color, and for, perhaps, the first time in
his life, quailed before the majesty of man; 'twas also
the majesty of suffering; for he had been torturing a noble
nature. Neither of them spoke for some time&mdash;Mr.
Aubrey continuing highly excited&mdash;Gammon gazing at
him with unfeigned amazement. The paper which he held
in his hand rustled, and he was obliged to lay it down on
his lap, lest Mr. Aubrey should notice this evidence of his
agitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am guilty of great weakness, sir," said at length Mr.
Aubrey&mdash;his excitement only a little abated. He stood
erect, and spoke with stern precision; "but you, perhaps
unconsciously, provoked the display of it. Sir, I am
ruined; I am a beggar: we are all ruined; we are all
beggars: it is the ordering of God, and I bow to it. But
do you presume, sir, to think that at last my <small>HONOR</small> is in
danger? and consider it necessary, as if you were warning
one whom you saw about to become a criminal, to expatiate
on the nature of the meditated act by which I am
to disgrace myself and my family?" Here <i>that family</i>
seemed suddenly standing around him: his lip quivered;
his eyes filled; he ceased speaking; and trembled with
excessive emotion.</p>

<p>"This is a sally equally unexpected, Mr. Aubrey, and,
permit me to add, unwarrantable," said Gammon, calmly,
having recovered his self-possession. "You have entirely
misunderstood me, sir; or I have ill-explained myself.
Your evident emotion and distress touch my very soul,
Mr. Aubrey." Gammon's voice trembled. "Suffer me
to tell you&mdash;unmoved by your violent rebuke&mdash;that I
feel an inexpressible respect and admiration for you, and
am miserable at the thought of one word of mine having
occasioned you an instant's uneasiness." When a generous
nature is thus treated, it is apt to feel an excessive
contrition for any fault or extravagance which it may
have committed&mdash;an excessive appreciation of the pain
which it may have inflicted on another. Thus it was,
that by the time Gammon had done speaking, Mr. Aubrey
felt ashamed and mortified at himself, and conceived an
admiration of the dignified forbearance of Gammon, which
quickly heightened into respect for his general character
as it appeared to Aubrey, and fervent gratitude for the
disposition which he had evinced, from first to last, so
disinterestedly to serve a ruined man. He seemed now
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
to view all that Gammon had proposed in quite a new
light&mdash;through quite another medium; and his excited
<i>feelings</i> were in some danger of disturbing his <i>judgment</i>.</p>

<p>"As I am a man of business, Mr. Aubrey," said Gammon,
shortly afterwards, with a very captivating smile&mdash;how
frank and forgiving seeming his temper, to Aubrey!&mdash;"and
this is a <i>place</i> for business, shall we resume our
conversation? With reference to the first ten thousand
pounds, it can be a matter of future arrangement as to
the mode of securing its payment; and as for the remaining
ten thousand, if I were not afraid of rendering myself
personally liable to Mr. Titmouse for neglecting my professional
duty to him, I should be content with your
verbal promise&mdash;your mere word of honor, to pay it, as
and when you conveniently could. But in justice to myself,
I really must take a <i>show</i> of security from you. Say,
for instance, two promissory notes, for £5,000 each, payable
to Mr. Titmouse. You may really regard them as
matters of mere form; for, when you shall have given
them to me, they will be deposited <i>there</i>," (pointing to an
iron safe,) "and not again be heard of until you may have
thought proper to inquire for them. The influence which
I happen to have obtained over Mr. Titmouse, you may
rely upon my exercising with some energy, if ever he
should be disposed to press you for payment of either of
the instruments I have mentioned. I tell you candidly
that they must be <i>negotiable</i> in point of form; but I assure
you, as sincerely, that I will not permit them to be
negotiated. <i>Now</i>, may I venture to hope that we understand
each other?" added Gammon, with a cheerful air;
"and that this arrangement, if I shall be only able to
carry it into effect, is a sufficient evidence of my desire to
serve you, and will relieve you from an immense load of
anxiety and liability?"</p>

<p>"An immense&mdash;a crushing load, indeed, sir, if Providence
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
shall in any manner (to me at present undiscoverable)
enable me to perform <i>my</i> part of the arrangement,
and if <i>you</i> have but power to carry your views into effect,"
replied Mr. Aubrey, sighing heavily, but with a look of
gratitude.</p>

<p>"Leave that to <i>me</i>, Mr. Aubrey; I will undertake to do
it; I will move heaven and earth to do it&mdash;and the more
eagerly, that I may thereby hope to establish a kind of
set-off against the misery and loss which my professional
exertions have unfortunately contributed to occasion you&mdash;and
your honored family!"</p>

<p>"I feel deeply sensible of your very great&mdash;your unexpected
kindness, Mr. Gammon; but still, the arrangement
suggested is one which occasions me dreadful anxiety as
to my being ever able to carry out <i>my</i> part of it."</p>

<p>"Never, never despair, Mr. Aubrey! Heaven helps
those who help themselves; and I really imagine I see
your powerful energies already beginning to surmount
your prodigious difficulties! When you shall have slept
over the matter, you will feel the full relief which this
proposed arrangement is so calculated to afford your
spirits. Of course, too, you will lose no time in communicating
to Messrs. Runnington the nature of the
proposal. I can predict that they will be not a little
disposed to urge upon you its completion. I cannot,
however, help once more reminding you, in justice to
myself, Mr. Aubrey, that it is <i>but</i> a proposition, in making
which, I hope it will not prove that I have been carried
away by my feelings much further than my duty to
my client or his interests "&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey was afraid to hear him finish the sentence,
lest the faint dawn of hope should disappear from the
dark and rough surface of the sea of trouble upon which
he was being tossed. "I <i>will</i> consult, as you suggest, sir,
my experienced and honorable professional advisers; and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
am strongly inclined to believe that they will feel as you
predict. I am of course bound to defer to <i>them</i>,"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly! certainly! I am very strict in the
observance of professional etiquette, Mr. Aubrey, I assure
you; and should not think of going on with this arrangement,
except with their concurrence, acting on your behalf.
One thing I have to beg, Mr. Aubrey, that either
you or they will communicate the result of your deliberations
to <i>me</i>, personally. I am very desirous that the
suggested compromise should be broken to my partners
and our client by <i>me.</i>&mdash;By the way, if you will favor
me with your address, I will make a point of calling at
your house, either late in the evening or early in the
morning."</p>

<p>[As if Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap had not kept
eagle eyes upon his every movement since quitting Yatton,
with a view to any sudden application for a writ of
<i>Ne Exeas</i>, which a suspicious approach of his towards the
sea-coast might render necessary!]</p>

<p>"I am infinitely obliged to you, sir&mdash;but it would be
far more convenient for both of us, if you could drop me
a line, or favor me with a call at Mr. Weasel's, in Pomegranate
Court in the Temple."</p>

<p>Gammon blushed scarlet: but for this accidental mention
of the name of Mr. Weasel, who was one of the pleaders
occasionally employed by Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap in heavy matters&mdash;in all probability Mr. Aubrey
might, within a day or two's time, have had to exercise
his faculties, if so disposed, upon a declaration of Trespass
for Mesne Profits, in a cause of "<span class="smcap">Titmouse</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Aubrey</span>!"</p>

<p>"As you choose, Mr. Aubrey," replied Gammon, with
difficulty concealing his feelings of pique and disappointment
at losing the opportunity of a <i>personal introduction
by Mr. Aubrey to his family</i>. After a few words of general
conversation, Gammon inquiring how Mr. Aubrey
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
liked his new profession, and assuring him, in an emphatic
manner, that he might rely upon being supported,
from the moment of his being called to the bar, by almost
all the common-law business of the firm of "Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap"&mdash;they parted. It had been to Mr.
Aubrey a memorable interview&mdash;and to Gammon a
somewhat arduous affair, taxing to an unusual extent his
great powers of self-command, and of dissimulation. As
soon as he was left alone, his thoughts instantly recurred
to Aubrey's singular burst of hauteur and indignation.
Gammon had a stinging sense of submission to superior
energy&mdash;and felt indignant with himself for not having
at the moment resented it. Setting aside this source of
exquisite irritation to the feelings of a proud man, he felt
a depressing consciousness that he had not met with his
usual success in his recent encounter with Mr. Aubrey;
who had been throughout cautious, watchful, and courteously
<i>distrustful</i>. He had afforded occasional glimpses of
the unapproachable pride of his nature&mdash;and Gammon
had crouched! Was there anything in their interview&mdash;thought
he, walking thoughtfully to and fro in his room&mdash;which,
when Aubrey came to reflect upon&mdash;for instance&mdash;had
Gammon disclosed too much concerning the
extent of his influence over Titmouse? His cheek slightly
flushed; a sigh of fatigue and excitement escaped him;
and gathering together his papers, he began to prepare
for quitting the office for the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey left Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap's
office with feelings of mingled exhaustion and despondency.
As he walked down Saffron Hill&mdash;a dismal neighborhood!&mdash;what
scenes did he witness! Poverty and
profligacy revelling, in all their wild and revolting excesses!
<i>Here</i>, was an Irishman, half-stupefied with liquor
and bathed in blood, having just been rescued from a
savage fight in a low underground public-house cellar, by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
his squalid wife, with dishevelled hair and a filthy infant
in her arms&mdash;who walked beside him cursing, pinching,
and striking him&mdash;reproaching him with the knowledge
that she and her seven children were lying starving at
home. Presently he stumbled; she with her wretched
infant falling down with him; and she lay striking, and
scratching, and abusing him till some one interfered.</p>

<p><i>There</i>, was a woman&mdash;as it were a bloated mass of filth
steeped in gin&mdash;standing with a drunken smile at an old-clothes
stall, pawning a dirty little shirt, which she had a
few minutes before stripped from the back of one of her
four half-naked children!</p>

<p>A little farther on, was a noisy excited crowd round
two men carrying a shutter, on which was strapped the
bleeding body (a handkerchief spread over the face) of a
poor bricklayer, who had fallen a few minutes before from
the top of some scaffolding in the neighborhood, and was
at that instant in the agonies of death&mdash;leaving behind
him a wife and nine children, for whom the poor fellow
had long slaved from morning to night, and who were now
ignorant of the frightful fate which had befallen him, and
that they were left utterly destitute.</p>

<p><i>There</i>, was a skinny little terrified urchin, about eight
years old, with nothing to conceal his dirty, half-starved
body, but a tattered man's coat, pinned round him; dying
with hunger, he had stolen a villanous-looking bare bone&mdash;scarce
a halfpenny worth of meat upon it; and a
brawny constable, his knuckles fiercely dug into the poor
little offender's neck, (with his tight grasp,) was leading
him off, followed by his shrieking mother, to the police-office,
whence he would be committed to Newgate; and
thence, after two or three months' imprisonment, and
being flogged&mdash;miserable little wretch!&mdash;by the common
hangman, (who had hanged the child's father some
six months before,) he would be discharged&mdash;to return
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
probably several times and undergo a similar process;
then to be transported; and finally be hanged, as had
been his father before him.</p>

<p>These startling scenes passed before Mr. Aubrey, in
the course of a five minutes' walk down Saffron Hill&mdash;during
which period he now and then paused, and gazed
around him with feelings of pity, of astonishment, of disgust,
which presently blended and deepened into a dark
sense of horror. These scenes, to some so fatally familiar&mdash;<i>fatally</i>,
I mean, on account of the <small>INDIFFERENCE</small> which
familiarity is apt to induce&mdash;to Mr. Aubrey, had on them
all the frightful glare of <i>novelty</i>. He had never witnessed
anything of the sort before; and had no notion of its existence.
The people residing on each side of the Hill,
however, seemed accustomed to such scenes; which they
appeared to view with the same dreadful indifference with
which a <i>lamb led to the slaughter</i> is beheld by one who has
spent his life next door to the slaughter-house. The Jew
clothesman, before whose shop-window, arrested by the
horrifying spectacle of the bleeding wretch borne along to
the hospital&mdash;Mr. Aubrey had remained standing for a
second or two&mdash;took the opportunity to assail him, with
insolent and pertinacious importunities to purchase some
articles of clothing! A fat baker, and a greasy eating-house
keeper, stood each at his door, one with folded arms,
the other with his hands thrust into his pockets&mdash;both
of them gazing with a grin at two curs fighting in the
middle of the street&mdash;oh, how utterly insensible to the
ravenous want around them! The pallid spectres haunting
the gin-shop&mdash;a large splendid building at the corner&mdash;gazed
with sunken lack-lustre eye, and drunken apathy,
at the shattered man who was being borne by.</p>

<p>Ah, God! what scenes were these! And of what other
hidden wretchedness and horror did they not indicate the
existence! "Gracious mercy!" thought Aubrey, "what
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
a world have I been living in! And this dismal aspect of
it exposed to me just when I have lost all power of relieving
its wretchedness!"&mdash;here a thrill of anguish passed
through his heart&mdash;"but woe, woe is me! if at this moment
I had a thousand times ten thousand a-year, how
far would it go amid the scenes similar to this, <i>abounding</i>
in this one city? Oh God! what unutterable horror must
be in store for those who, intrusted by Thee with an overflowing
abundance, disregard the misery around them in
guilty selfishness and indolence, or"&mdash;he shuddered&mdash;"expend
it in sensuality and profligacy! Will <span class="smcap">Dives</span> become
sensible of his misconduct, only when he shall have
entered upon his next stage of existence, and of punishment?
Oh, merciful Creator! how is my heart wrung
by the sight of horrors such as these? Awful and mysterious
Author of our existence, <i>Father of the spirits of all
flesh</i>, are these states of being which Thou hast ordained?
Are these Thy children? Are these my fellow-creatures?
Oh, help me! help me! my weak heart faints; my clouded
understanding is confounded! I cannot&mdash;insect that I
am!&mdash;discern the scope and end of Thy economy, of Thy
dread government of the world; yet blessed be the name
of my God!&mdash;I <small>KNOW</small> that <i>thou reignest!</i> though <i>clouds
and darkness are around thee!</i> <i>righteousness and judgment
are the habitation of thy throne!</i> <i>with righteousness shalt
thou judge the world</i>, <small>AND THE PEOPLE WITH EQUITY!</small>"</p>

<p>Like as the lesser light is lost in the greater, so, in
Aubrey's case, was the lesser misery he suffered, merged
in his sense of the greater misery he witnessed. What,
after all, was his position, in comparison with that of
those now before and around him? What cause of thankfulness
had he not, for the merciful mildness of even the
dispensations of Providence towards him? Such were his
thoughts and feelings, as he stood gazing at the objects
which had called them forth, when his eye lit on the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
figure of Mr. Gammon approaching him. He was threading
his way, apparently lost in thought, through the
scenes which had so powerfully affected Mr. Aubrey; who
stood eying him with a sort of unconscious intensity,
as if secure from his observation, till he was actually
addressed by him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Aubrey!" exclaimed Gammon, courteously saluting
him. Each took off his hat to the other. Though
Aubrey hardly intended it, he found himself engaged in
conversation with Gammon, who, in a remarkably feeling
tone, and with a happy flattering deference of manner,
intimated that he could guess the subject of Mr. Aubrey's
thoughts, namely, the absorbing matters which they had
been discussing together.</p>

<p>"No, it is not so," said Mr. Aubrey, with a sigh, as he
walked on&mdash;Gammon keeping easily beside him&mdash;"I
have been profoundly affected by scenes which I have
witnessed in the immediate neighborhood of your office,
since quitting it; what misery! what horror!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Aubrey!"&mdash;exclaimed Gammon, echoing
the sigh of his companion, as they slowly ascended Holborn
Hill, separate, but side by side&mdash;"what a checkered
scene is life! Guilt and innocence&mdash;happiness and misery&mdash;wealth
and poverty&mdash;disease and health&mdash;wisdom and
folly&mdash;sensuality and refinement&mdash;piety and irreligion&mdash;how
strangely intermingled we behold them, wherever
we look on life&mdash;and how difficult, to the philosopher, to
detect the principle"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Difficult?&mdash;Impossible! Impossible! God alone can
do so!"&mdash;exclaimed Mr. Aubrey, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Comparison, I have often thought," said Gammon,
after a pause&mdash;"of one's own troubles with the greater
misfortunes endured by others, is beneficial or prejudicial&mdash;consolatory
or disheartening&mdash;according as the
mind of him who makes the comparison is well or ill
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
regulated&mdash;possessed or destitute, of moral and religious
principle!"</p>

<p>"It is so, indeed," said Mr. Aubrey. Though not particularly
inclined to enter into or prolong conversation, he
was pleased with the tone of his companion's remark.</p>

<p>"As for me," proceeded Gammon, with a slight sigh&mdash;"the
absorbing anxieties of professional life; and, too, in
a line of professional life which, infinitely to my distaste,
brings me constantly into scenes such as you have been
observing, have contributed to render me, I fear, less
sensible of their real character; yet can I vividly conceive
the effect they must, when first seen, produce upon the
mind and heart of a compassionate, an observant, a reflecting
man, Mr. Aubrey!"</p>

<p>Gammon looked a gentleman; his address was easy and
insinuating, full of delicate deference, without the slightest
tendency to cant or sycophancy; his countenance was
an intellectual and expressive one; his conversation that
of an educated and thinking man. He was striving his
utmost to produce a favorable impression on Mr. Aubrey;
and, as is very little to be wondered at, he succeeded.
By the time that they had got about twenty yards beyond
Fetter Lane, they might have been seen walking together,
arm-in-arm. As they approached Oxford Street, they suddenly
encountered Mr. Runnington.</p>

<p>"God bless me, Mr. Aubrey!" said he, surprisedly&mdash;"and
Mr. Gammon? How do you do, Mr. Gammon?"&mdash;he
continued, taking off his hat with a little formality,
and speaking in a corresponding tone; but he was encountered
by Gammon with greatly superior ease and distance,
and was not a little nettled at it; for he was so
palpably foiled with his own weapons.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I shall now resign you to your legitimate adviser,
Mr. Aubrey," said Gammon, with a smile; then,
addressing Mr. Runnington, in whose countenance pique
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
and pride were abundantly visible&mdash;"Mr. Aubrey has
favored me with a call to-day, and we have had some little
discussion on a matter which he will explain to you. As
for me, Mr. Aubrey, I ought to have turned off two streets
ago&mdash;so I wish you good-evening."</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey and he shook hands as they exchanged
adieus: Mr. Runnington and he simply raised each his
hat, and bowed to the other with cold politeness. As
Mr. Runnington and Mr. Aubrey walked westward together,
the former, who was a very cautious man, did not
think fit to express the uneasiness he felt at Mr. Aubrey's
having entered into anything like confidential intercourse
with one whom he believed to be so subtle and dangerous
a person as Mr. Gammon. He was, however, very greatly
surprised when he came to hear of the proposal which
had been made by Mr. Gammon, concerning the mesne
profits; which, he said, was so unaccountably reasonable
and liberal, considering the parties by whom it was made,
that he feared Mr. Aubrey must be lying under some mistake.
He would, however, turn it anxiously over in his
mind, and consult with his partners; and, in short, do
whatever they conceived best for Mr. Aubrey&mdash;that he
might depend upon. "And, in the mean time, my dear
sir," added Mr. Runnington, with a smile designed to disguise
considerable anxiety, "it may be as well for you not
to have any further personal communication with these
parties, whom you do not know as well as we do; but
let <i>us</i> negotiate with them in everything, even the very
least!" Thus they parted; and Mr. Aubrey entered
Vivian Street with a considerably lighter heart than he
had ever before carried into it. A vivid recollection of
the scenes which he had witnessed at Saffron Hill, caused
him exquisitely to appreciate the comforts of his little
home, and to return the welcomes and caresses which he
received, with a kind of trembling tenderness and energy.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
As he folded his still blooming but somewhat anxious wife
fondly to his bosom, kissed his high-spirited and lovely
sister, and fondled the prattling innocents who came clambering
up upon his lap, he forgot, for a while, the difficulties
but remembered the <i>lessons</i>, of the day.</p>

<p>We must, however, now return to Yatton, where some
matters had transpired which are not unworthy of being
recorded. Though Mr. Yahoo paid rather anxious court
to Mr. Gammon, who was very far too much for him in
every way, 'twas plain that he dreaded and disliked, as
much as he was despised by, that gentleman. Mr. Gammon
had easily extracted from Titmouse evidence that
Yahoo was endeavoring, from time to time, artfully to
set him against his protector, Mr. Gammon. This was
<i>something</i>; but more than this&mdash;Yahoo, a reckless rollicking
villain, was obtaining a growing ascendency over
Titmouse, whom he was rapidly initiating into all kinds
of vile habits and practices; and, in short, completely
corrupting him. But, above all, Gammon ascertained
that Yahoo had already commenced, with great success,
his experiments upon the purse of Titmouse. Before
they had been a week at Yatton, down came a splendid
billiard-table with its appendages from London, accompanied
by a man to fix it&mdash;as he did&mdash;in the library,
which he quickly denuded of all traces of its former character;
and here Yahoo, Titmouse, and Fitz-Snooks would
pass a good deal of their time. Then they would have tables
and chairs, with cards, cigars, and brandy and water,
placed upon the beautiful "soft, smooth-shaven lawn,"
and sit there playing <i>écarté</i>, at once pleasantly soothed
and stimulated by their cigars and brandy and water, for
half a day together. Then Yahoo got up frequent excursions
to Grilston, and even to York; where, together with
his two companions, he had "great sport," as the newspapers
began to intimate with growing frequency and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
distinctness. Actuated by that execrable licentiousness
with reference to the female sex, by which he was peculiarly
distinguished, and of which he boasted, he had got
into several curious adventures with farmers' girls, and
others in the vicinity of Yatton, and even among the female
members of the establishment at the Hall; in which
latter quarter Fitz-Snooks and Titmouse began to imitate
his example. Mr. Gammon had conceived a horrid
loathing and disgust for the miscreant leader into these
enormities; and, but for certain consequences, would have
despatched him with as much indifference as he would
have laid arsenic in the way of a bold voracious rat, or
killed a snake. As it was, he secretly caused him to experience,
on one or two occasions, the effects of his good-will
towards him. Yahoo had offered certain atrocious
indignities to the sweetheart of a strapping young farmer;
whose furious complaints coming to Mr. Gammon's ears,
that gentleman, under a pledge of secrecy, gave him two
guineas to be on the look-out for Yahoo, and give him
the best taste he could of a pair of Yorkshire fists. A
day or two afterwards, the Satyr fell in with his unsuspected
enemy. Yahoo was a strongly-built man, and an
excellent bruiser; but was at first disposed to shirk the
fight, on glancing at the prodigious proportions of Hazel,
and the fury flaming in his eyes. The instant, however,
that he saw the fighting attitude into which poor Hazel
had thrown himself, Yahoo smiled, stripped, and set to.
I am sorry to say that it was a good while before Hazel
could get one single blow at his accomplished opponent;
whom, however, he at length began to wear out. Then
he gave the Yahoo a miserable pommelling, to be sure;
and finished by knocking out five of his front teeth, viz.
three in the upper, and two in the under jaw&mdash;beautifully
white and regular they certainly had been; and the
loss of them caused him great affliction on the score of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
his appearance, and also, not a little interfered with the
process of cigar-smoking. It would, besides, have debarred
him, had he been so disposed, from enlisting as
a soldier, inasmuch as he could not bite off the end of
his cartridge: wherefore, it would seem, that Hazel had
committed the offence of <i>Mayhem</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Mr. Gammon condoled
heartily with Mr. Yahoo, on hearing of the brutal
attack which had been made upon him; and as the assault
had not been committed in the presence of a witness,
strongly recommended him to bring an action of
trespass <i>vi et armis</i> against Hazel, which Gammon undertook
to conduct to&mdash;a nonsuit. While they were conversing
in this friendly way together, it suddenly occurred to
Gammon that there was another service which he could
render to Mr. Yahoo, and with equally strict observance
of the injunction, <i>not to let his left hand know what his
right hand did</i>; for he loved the character of a secret
benefactor. So he wrote up a letter to Snap, (whom he
knew to have been treated very insolently by Yahoo,)
desiring him to go to two or three Jew bill-brokers and
money-lenders, and ascertain whether they had any paper
by them with the name of "Yahoo" upon it:&mdash;and in
the event of such being discovered, he was to act in the
manner pointed out by Gammon. Off went Snap like a
shot, on receiving this letter; and the very first gentleman
he applied to, viz. a Mr. <span class="smcap">Suck'em Dry</span>, proved to be
possessed of an acceptance of Yahoo's for £200, for which
Dry had given only twenty-five pounds, on speculation.
He readily yielded to Snap's offer, to give him a shy at Mr.
Yahoo <i>gratis</i>&mdash;and put the document into the hands of
Snap; who forthwith delivered it, confidentially, to Swinddle
Shark, gent., one &amp;c., a little Jew attorney in Chancery
Lane, into whose office the dirty work of Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap was swept&mdash;in cases where they did not choose
to appear. I wish the mutilated Yahoo could have seen
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
the mouthful of glittering teeth that were displayed by
the hungry Jew, on receiving the above commission. His
duties, though of a painful, were of a brief and simple description.
'Twas a plain case of <i>Indorsee</i> v. <i>Acceptor</i>. The
affidavit of debt was sworn the same afternoon; and within
an hour's time afterwards, a thin slip of paper was delivered
into the hands of the under-sheriff of Yorkshire,
commanding him to take the body<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of Pimp Yahoo, if
he should be found in his bailiwick, and him safely keep&mdash;out
of harm's way&mdash;to enable him to pay £200 <i>debt</i>
to Suck'em Dry, and £24, 6s. 10d. <i>costs</i> to Swindle Shark.
Down went that little "infernal machine" to Yorkshire by
that night's post.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the astonishment and concern
with which Mr. Gammon, the evening but one afterwards,
on returning to the Hall from a ride to Grilston, heard
Titmouse and Fitz-Snooks&mdash;deserted beings!&mdash;tell him
how, an hour before, two big vulgar fellows, one of them
with a long slip of paper in his hands, had called at the
Hall, asked for the innocent unsuspecting Yahoo, just as
he had made an admirable <i>coup</i>&mdash;and insisted on his
accompanying them to the house of one of the aforesaid
bailiffs, and then on to York Castle. They had brought
a tax-cart with them for his convenience; and into it,
between his two new friends, was forced to get the astounded
Yahoo&mdash;smoking, as well as he could, a cigar,
with some score or two of which he had filled all his
pockets, and swearing oaths enough to have lasted the
whole neighborhood for a fortnight at least. Mr. Gammon
was quite shocked at the indignity which had been
perpetrated, and asked why the villains had not been
kept till he could have been sent for. Then, leaving the
melancholy Titmouse and Fitz-Snooks to themselves for
a little while, he took a solitary walk in the elm avenue,
where&mdash;grief has different modes of expressing itself&mdash;he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
relieved his excited feelings by reiterated little bursts
of gentle laughter. As soon as the <i>York True Blue</i> had,
among other intimations of fashionable movements, informed
the public that "<i>The Hon.</i> Pimp Yahoo" had
quitted Yatton Hall for York Castle, where he intended
to remain and receive a large party of friends&mdash;it was
gratifying to see how soon, and in what force, they began
to muster and rally round him. "<i>Detainers</i>"<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;so that
species of visiting cards is called&mdash;came fluttering in like
snow; and in short, there was no end of the messages of
civility and congratulation which he received from those
whom, in the season of his prosperity, he had obliged with
his valuable countenance and custom.</p>

<p>Ah me, poor Yahoo, completely done! Oft is it, in this
infernal world of ours, that the best concerted schemes
are thus suddenly defeated by the envious and capricious
fates! Thus were thy arms suddenly held back from
behind, just as they were encircling as pretty, plump a
pigeon as ever nestled in them with pert and playful confidence,
to be plucked! Alas, alas! And didst thou behold
the danger to which it was exposed, as it fluttered
upward unconsciously into the region where thine affectionate
eye detected the keen hawk in deadly poise? Ah
me! Oh dear! What shall I do? What can I say? How
vent my grief for the Prematurely Caged?</p>

<p>Poor Titmouse was very dull for some little time after
this sudden abduction of this bold and brilliant spirit,
and spoke of bringing an action, at the suggestion of Fitz-Snooks,
against the miscreant who had dared to set the
law in motion at Yatton, under the very nose of its lord
and master. As soon, however, as Gammon intimated to
him that all those who had lent Yahoo money, might now
rely upon that gentleman's honor, and whistle back their
cash at their leisure, Titmouse burst out into a great rage;
telling Gammon that he, Titmouse, had only a day or two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
before lent Yahoo £150!! and that he was a "cursed
scamp," who had known, when he borrowed, that he could
not repay; and a Detainer, at the suit of "Tittlebat Titmouse,
Esq.," was one of the very earliest that found its
way into the sheriff's office; this new creditor becoming
one of the very bitterest and most relentless against the
fallen Yahoo, except, perhaps, Mr. Fitz-Snooks. That
gentleman having lent the amiable Yahoo no less a sum
than thirteen hundred pounds, remained easy all the
while, under the impression that certain precious documents
called "I.O.U.'s" of the said Yahoo were as good
as cash. He was horribly dismayed on discovering that
it was otherwise; that <i>he</i> was not to be paid before all
other creditors, and immediately; so he also sent a very
special message in the shape of a Detainer, backed by a
great number of curses.</p>

<p>In process of time Mr. Yahoo bethought himself of
getting "<i>white-washed</i>;" but when he came to be inspected,
it was considered that he was not properly <i>seasoned</i>;
so the operation was delayed for two years, under
a very arbitrary statute, which enacted, "that if it should
appear that the said prisoner had contracted any of his
debts <i>fraudulently</i>, or by means of <i>false pretences</i>, or <i>without
having had any reasonable or probable expectation, at
the time when contracted, of paying the same</i>," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.,
"or should be indebted for damages recovered in any
<i>action for criminal conversation</i>, or <i>seduction</i>, or for <i>malicious
injuries</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c., such prisoner should be discharged
as to such debts and damages, so soon only as he should
have been in custody at the suit of such creditors for a
period or periods not exceeding two years." Such is the
odious restraint upon the liberty of the subject, which at
this day, in the nineteenth century, is suffered to disgrace
the statute law of England; for, in order to put <i>other
Yahoos</i> upon their guard against the cruel and iniquitous
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
designs upon them, I here inform them that the laws
under which Mr. Yahoo suffered his two years' incarceration,
(every one of his debts, &amp;c., coming under one or
other of the descriptions above mentioned,) are, <i>proh
pudor</i>! re-enacted and at this moment in force, and
in augmented stringency,<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> as several most respectable
gentlemen, if you could only get access to them, would
tell you.</p>

<p>Yahoo having been thus adroitly disposed of, Mr. Gammon
had the gratification of finding that mischievous
simpleton, Fitz-Snooks, very soon afterwards take his departure.
He pined for the pleasures of the town, which
he had money enough to enjoy for about three years
longer, with economy; after which he might go abroad,
or to <i>the dogs</i>&mdash;wherever they were to be found. 'Twas
indeed monstrous dull at Yatton; the game which Yahoo
had given him a taste for was so very <i>strictly preserved</i>
there! and the birds so uncommon shy and wild, and
strong on the wing! Besides, Gammon's presence was a
terrible pressure upon him; overawing and benumbing
him, in spite of several attempts which he had made,
when charged with the requisite quantity of wine, to
exhibit an impertinent familiarity, or even defiance. As
soon as poor Titmouse had bade Fitz-Snooks good-by,
shaken hands with him, and lost sight of him&mdash;Titmouse
was at Yatton, <i>alone with Gammon</i>, and felt as if
a spell were upon him.&mdash;He was completely cowed and
prostrate. Yet Gammon laid himself out to the very
uttermost, to please him, and reassure his drooping
spirits. Titmouse had got into his head that the mysterious
and dreadful Gammon had, in some deep way or
other, been at the bottom of Yahoo's abduction, and of
the disappearance of Fitz-Snooks, and would, by-and-by,
do as much for <i>him</i>! He had no feeling of <i>ownership</i>
of Yatton; but of being, as it were, only tenant-at-will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
thereof to Mr. Gammon. Whenever he tried to reassure
himself, by repeating that it did not signify&mdash;for Yatton
was his own&mdash;and he might do as he liked; his feelings
might be compared to a balloon, which, with the eyes of
eager and anxious thousands upon it, yet cannot get inflated
sufficiently to rise one inch from the ground. How
was it? Mr. Gammon's manner towards him was most
uncommonly respectful; what else could he wish for?
Yet he would have given a thousand pounds to that gentleman
to take himself off, and never show his nose again
at Yatton! It annoyed him, too, more than he could express,
to perceive the deference and respect which every
one at the Hall manifested towards Mr. Gammon. Titmouse
would sometimes stamp his foot, when alone, with
childish fury on the ground, when he thought of it. When
at dinner, and sitting together afterwards, Gammon would
rack his invention for jokes and anecdotes to amuse Titmouse&mdash;who
would certainly give a kind of laugh; exclaim,
"Bravo! Ha, ha! 'Pon my life!&mdash;capital!&mdash;By
Jove! Most uncommon good! you don't say so?"&mdash;and
go on, drinking glass after glass of wine, or brandy
and water, and smoking cigar after cigar, till he felt fuddled
and sick, in which condition he would retire to bed,
and leave Gammon, clear and serene in head and temper,
to his meditations. When, at length, he broached the
subject of <i>their bill</i>&mdash;a frightful amount it was; of the
moneys advanced by Mr. Quirk, for his support for eight
or nine months on a liberal scale, and which mounted up
to a sum infinitely larger than could have been supposed;
and lastly, of the bond for ten thousand pounds, as the
just reward to the firm for their long-continued, most
anxious, and successful exertions on their client's behalf&mdash;Titmouse
mustered up all his resolution, as for a last
desperate struggle; swore they were robbing him; and
added, with a furious snap of the fingers, "they had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
better take the estate themselves&mdash;allow him a pound
a-week, and send him back to Tag-rag's." Then he burst
into tears, and cried like a child, long and bitterly.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Gammon, after remaining silent for
some time, looking at Titmouse calmly, but with an expression
of face which frightened him out of his wits, "if
this is to be really the way in which I am to be treated
by you&mdash;I, the only <i>real disinterested</i> friend you have in
the world, (as you have had hundreds of opportunities of
ascertaining;) if my advice is to be spurned, and my
motives suspected; if your first and deliberate engagements
to our firm are to be wantonly broken"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, but, 'pon my soul, I was humbugged into making
them," said Titmouse, passionately.</p>

<p>"Why, you little miscreant!" exclaimed Gammon,
starting up in his chair, and gazing at him as if he would
have scorched him with his eye, "Do you <small>DARE</small> to say so?
If you have no gratitude&mdash;have you lost your <i>memory</i>?
What were you when I dug you out of your filthy hole
at Closet Court? Did you not repeatedly go down on
your knees to us? Did you not promise, a thousand
times, to do infinitely more than you are now called upon
to do? And is this, you insolent&mdash;despicable little insect!&mdash;is
<i>this</i> the return you make us for putting you, a
beggar&mdash;and very nearly too, an idiot"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're most uncommon polite," said Titmouse, suddenly
and bitterly.</p>

<p>"Silence, sir! I am in no humor for trifling!" interrupted
Gammon, sternly. "I say, is <i>this</i> the return you
think of making us; not only to insult us, but refuse to
pay money actually advanced by us to save you from
starvation&mdash;money, and days and nights, and weeks
and months, and <i>many</i> months of intense anxiety, expended
in discovering how to put you in possession of
a splendid fortune?&mdash;Poh! you miserable little trifler!&mdash;why
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
should I trouble myself thus? Remember&mdash;remember,
Tittlebat Titmouse," continued Gammon, in a
low tone, and extending towards him threateningly his
thin forefinger, "I who made you, will in one day&mdash;one
single day&mdash;unmake you&mdash;will blow you away like a
bit of froth; you shall never be seen, or heard of, or
thought of, except by some small draper whose unhappy
shopman you may be!"</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;'pon my life! Dare say you think I'm uncommon
frightened! Ah, ha! Monstrous&mdash;particular
good!" said Titmouse, desperately.</p>

<p>Gammon perceived that he trembled in every limb;
and the smile which he tried to throw into his face was
so wretched, that, had you seen him at that moment, and
considered his position, much and justly as you now despise
him, you must have pitied him. "You're always
now going on in this way!&mdash;It's all so very likely!"
continued he. "Why, 'pon my soul, am not I to be <span class="smcap">A
LORD</span> one of these days? Can you help that? Can you
send a lord behind a draper's counter? 'Pon my soul,
what do you say to that? I like that, uncommon"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do I say?" replied Gammon, calmly, "why,
that I've a great mind to say and do something that
would make you&mdash;would dispose you to&mdash;jump head
foremost into the first sewer you came near!"</p>

<p>Titmouse's heart was lying fluttering at his throat.</p>

<p>"Tittlebat, Tittlebat!" continued Gammon, dropping
his voice, and speaking in a very kind and earnest manner,
"if you did but know the extent to which an accident
has placed you in my power! at this moment in my
power! Really I almost tremble, myself, to think of
it!" He rose, brought his chamber-candlestick out of
the hall&mdash;lit it&mdash;bade Titmouse good-night, sadly but
sternly&mdash;and shook him by the hand&mdash;"I may rid you
of my presence to-morrow morning, Mr. Titmouse.  I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
shall leave you to <i>try to enjoy Yatton</i>! May you find a
<i>truer</i>&mdash;a more powerful friend than you will have lost in
me!" Titmouse never shrank more helplessly under the
eye of Mr. Gammon than he did at that moment.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;<i>won't</i> stop and smoke another cigar
with a poor devil, will you, Mr. Gammon?" he inquired
faintly. "It's somehow&mdash;most uncommon lonely in this
queer, large, old-fashioned"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Gammon, peremptorily&mdash;and withdrew,
leaving Titmouse in a state of mingled alarm and
anger&mdash;the former, however, predominating.</p>

<p>"By jingo!" he at length exclaimed with a heavy sigh,
after a revery of about three minutes, gulping down the
remainder of his brandy and water, "If that same gent,
Mr. Gammon, a'n't the&mdash;the&mdash;devil&mdash;he's the very
best imitation of him that ever I heard tell of!" Here
he glanced furtively round the room; then he got a little
flustered; rang his bell quickly for his valet, and, followed
by him, retired to his dressing-room.</p>

<p>The next morning the storm had entirely blown over.
When they met at breakfast, Titmouse, as Gammon had
known would be the case, was all submission and respect;
in fact, it was evident that he was thoroughly frightened
by what had fallen from Gammon, but infinitely more so
by the <i>manner</i> in which he had spoken over-night. Gammon,
however, preserved for some little time the haughty
air with which he had met Titmouse; but a few words of
the latter, expressing deep regret for what he had said
through having drunk too much&mdash;poor little soul!&mdash;over-night,
and his unqualifyingly submitting to every
one of the requisitions which had been insisted on by Mr.
Gammon&mdash;quickly dispersed the cloud settled on that
gentleman's brow, when he entered the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>, my dear Mr. Titmouse," said he, very graciously,
"you show yourself the gentleman I always took you for&mdash;and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
I forget, forever, all that passed between us, so
unpleasantly, last night. I am sure it will never be so
again: for now we <i>entirely</i> understand each other?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;'pon my life&mdash;quite entirely!" replied Titmouse,
meekly, with a crestfallen air.</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast they adjourned, at Gammon's request,
to the billiard-room; where, though that gentleman
knew how to handle a cue, and Titmouse did not, he
expressed great admiration for Titmouse's play, and felt
great interest in being shown by him how to get a ball,
now and then, into each pocket at one stroke, a masterly
man&#339;uvre in which Titmouse succeeded two or three
times, and Gammon not once, during their hour's play.
Upon that occasion had occurred the conversation in
which Titmouse made the suggestion we have already
heard of, viz. that Gammon should immediately clap the
screw upon Aubrey, with a view to squeezing out of him
at least sufficient to pay the £10,000 bond, and their bill
of costs, immediately; and Titmouse urged Gammon at
once to send Aubrey packing after Yahoo to York Castle,
as an inducement to an early settlement of the remainder.
Gammon, however, assured Mr. Titmouse, that in all
probability Mr. Aubrey had not a couple of thousand
pounds in the world.</p>

<p>"Well, that will do to begin with," said Titmouse,
"and the rest <i>must</i> come, sooner or later&mdash;eh, by
Jove?"</p>

<p>"Leave him to me, my dear Titmouse, or rather to
Mr. Quirk&mdash;who'll <i>wring</i> him before he's done with him,
I warrant you! But, in the mean while, if I work day
and night, I will relieve you from this claim of Mr. Quirk:
for, in fact, I have little or no <i>real</i> interest in the matter."</p>

<p>"You'll take a slapping slice out of the bond, eh?
Aha, Mr. Gammon!&mdash;But what were you saying you'd
do for me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"I repeat, that I am your only disinterested friend,
Mr. Titmouse; I shall never see a hundred pounds of
what is going into Mr. Quirk's hands; who, I must say,
however," added Gammon, with sudden caution, "has
richly earned what he's going to get&mdash;but&mdash;to say the
truth, by following my directions throughout. I was saying,
however, that I had hit upon a scheme for ridding
you of your difficulties. Though you have only just
stepped into your property, and consequently people are
very shy of advancing money on mortgage, if you'll only
keep quiet, and leave the affair entirely to me, I will
undertake to get you a sum of possibly twenty thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>"My eyes!" exclaimed Titmouse, excitedly; quickly,
however, adding with a sad air&mdash;"but then, what a lot
of it will go to old Quirk?"</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> rather a keen and hard&mdash;ahem! I own;
but"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, couldn't we <i>do</i> the old gent?"</p>

<p>"On no consideration, Mr. Titmouse; it would be a
fatal step for you&mdash;and indeed for me."</p>

<p>"What! and can <i>he</i> do anything, too? I thought it
was only you."&mdash;The little fool had brought a glimpse
of color into Gammon's cheek&mdash;but Titmouse's volatility
quickly relieved his tripping Prospero. "By the way&mdash;'pon
my life&mdash;sha'n't I have to pay it all back again!
There's a go! I hadn't thought of that."</p>

<p>"I shall first try to get it out of Mr. Aubrey," said
Gammon, "and then out of another friend of yours. In
the mean while we must not drop the Tag-rags just yet."
They then got into a long and confidential conversation
together; in the course of which, Titmouse happened to
pop out a little secret of his, which till then he had
managed to keep from Gammon, and which occasioned
that gentleman a great and sudden inward confusion&mdash;one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
which it was odd that so keen an observer as Titmouse
did not perceive indications of in the countenance
of Gammon; viz. his&mdash;Titmouse's&mdash;fervent and disinterested
love for Miss Aubrey. While he was rattling on
with eager volubility upon this topic, Gammon, after casting
about a little in his mind, as to how he should deal
with this interesting discovery, resolved for the present
to humor the notion, and got out of Titmouse a full and
particular account of his original "<i>smite</i>," as that gentleman
called his passion for Miss Aubrey&mdash;the indelible
impression she had made on his heart&mdash;the letter which
he had addressed to her&mdash;[here Gammon's vivid fancy
portrayed to him the sort of composition which must have
reached Miss Aubrey, and he nearly burst into a gentle
fit of laughter]&mdash;and, with a strange candor, or rather,
to do him justice, with that frank simplicity which is
characteristic of noble natures&mdash;he at length described
his unlucky encounter with Miss Aubrey and her maid,
in the winter; whereat Gammon felt a sort of sudden inward
spasm, which excited a certain twinging sensation
in his right toe&mdash;but it passed away&mdash;'twas after all,
only a little juvenile indiscretion of Titmouse's; but
Gammon, with rather a serious air, assured Titmouse
that he had probably greatly endangered his prospect
with Miss Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Eh? Why, devil take it! a'n't I going to offer to her,
though she's got nothing?" interrupted Titmouse, with
astonishment.</p>

<p>"True!&mdash;Ah, I had lost sight of that. Well, if you
will pledge yourself to address no more letters to her,
nor take any steps to see her, without first communicating
with me&mdash;I think I can promise&mdash;hem!" he looked
archly at Titmouse.</p>

<p>"She's a most <i>uncommon</i> lovely gal"&mdash;he simpered
sheepishly. The fact was that Gammon had conceived
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
quite another scheme for Titmouse&mdash;wholly inconsistent
with his pure, ardent, and enlightened attachment to
Miss Aubrey; 'twas undoubtedly rather a bold and ambitious
one, but Gammon did not despair; for he had
that confidence in himself, and in his knowledge of human
nature, which always supported him in the most
arduous and apparently hopeless undertakings.</p>

<p>There was a visible alteration for the better in the state
of things at Yatton, as soon as Messrs. Yahoo and Fitz-Snooks
had been disposed of. Now and then a few of the
distinguished people who had honored Mr. Titmouse by
going out in procession to meet and welcome him, were
invited to spend a day at Yatton; and generally quitted
full of admiration of the dinner and wines, the unaffected
good-nature and simplicity of their hospitable host, and
the bland, composed, and intellectual deportment and
conversation of Mr. Gammon. When rent-day arrived,
Mr. Titmouse, attended by Mr. Gammon, made his appearance
in the steward's room, and also in the hall;
where, according to former custom, good substantial fare
was set out for the tenants. They received him with
a due respect of manner; but&mdash;alas&mdash;where was the
cheerfulness, the cordiality, the rough, honest heartiness
of days gone by, on such occasions? Few of the tenants
stayed to partake of the good things prepared for them;
a circumstance which greatly affected Mr. Griffiths, and
piqued Mr. Gammon; as for Titmouse, however, he said,
with a laugh, "Curse 'em! let 'em leave it alone, if they
a'n't hungry!" and any faint feeling of mortification
which he might have experienced, was dissipated by the
intelligence of the amount paid into his banker's. Gammon
was sensible that the scenes which had been exhibited
at Yatton on the first night of his protégé's
arrival, had seriously injured him in the neighborhood
and county, and was bent upon effacing, as quickly as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
possible, such unfavorable impressions, by prevailing on
Titmouse to "purge and live cleanly"&mdash;at all events
for the present.</p>

<p>Let me pause now, for a moment, to inquire, ought not
this favored young man to have felt happy? Here he
was, master of a fine estate, producing him a splendid unencumbered
rent-roll; a delightful residence, suggesting
innumerable dear and dignified associations connected with
old English feeling; a luxurious table, with the choicest
liqueurs and wines, in abundance: he might smoke the
finest cigars that the world could produce, from morning
to night, if so disposed; had unlimited facilities for securing
a distinguished personal appearance, as far as dress
and decoration went; had all the amusements of the
county at his command; troops of servants, eager and
obsequious in their attentions; horses and carriages of
every description which he might have chosen to order
out&mdash;had, in short, all the "appliances and means to
boot," which could be desired or imagined by a gentleman
of his station and affluence. Mr. Gammon was, though
somewhat stern and plain-spoken, still a most sincere and
powerful friend, deeply and disinterestedly solicitous about
his interests, and protecting him from villanous and designing
adventurers; then he had in prospect the brilliant
mazes of fashionable life in town&mdash;oh, in the name of everything
that this world can produce, and of the feelings
it should excite, ought not Titmouse to have enjoyed life&mdash;to
have been happy? Yet he was not; he felt, quite
independently of any constraint occasioned by the presence
of Mr. Gammon, full of deplorable and inexpressible
wearisomeness, which nothing could alleviate, but the
constant use of cigars, and brandy and water. On the
first Sunday after the departure of Fitz-Snooks, Titmouse
was prevailed upon to accompany the devout and exemplary
Gammon to church; where, barring a good many
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
ill-concealed yawns and constant fidgetiness, he conducted
himself with tolerable decorum. Yet still the style of his
dress, his air, and his countenance, filled the little congregation
with feelings of great astonishment, when they
thought that <i>that</i> was the new Squire of Yatton, and for
a moment contrasted him with his simple and dignified
predecessor, Mr. Aubrey. As for the worthy vicar, Dr.
Tatham, Gammon resolved to secure his good graces, and
succeeded. He called upon the worthy vicar soon after
having heard from Titmouse, of his, Yahoo's, and Fitz-Snooks'
encounter with Dr. Tatham; and expressed profound
concern on being apprised of the rude treatment
which he had encountered. There was a gentleness and
affability&mdash;tempering at once and enhancing his evident
acuteness and knowledge of the world&mdash;which quite captivated
the little doctor. But, above all, the expressions
of delicate sympathy and regret with which he now and
then alluded to the late occupants of Yatton, and towards
whom the stern requisitions of professional duty had
caused him to play so odious a part, and his minute inquiries
about them, drew out almost all that was in
the little doctor's heart concerning his departed friends.
Gammon gazed with deep interest at the old blind staghound,
and feeble old Peggy; and seemed never tired
of hearing the doctor's little anecdotes concerning them.
He introduced Titmouse to the vicar; and, in his presence,
Gammon declared his (Titmouse's) hatred and contempt
for the two fellows who were with him when first he saw
Dr. Tatham; who thereupon banished from his heart all
recollection of the conduct which had so deeply hurt his
feelings. Gammon, on another occasion, infinitely delighted
the doctor by calling on a Monday morning, and
alluding with evident interest and anxiety to certain passages
in his sermon of the day before, and which led to
a very lengthened and interesting discussion. In consequence
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
of what then transpired, the doctor suddenly bethought
himself of routing out an old sermon, which he
had once preached before the judges of assize:&mdash;and during
the week he touched it up with a good deal of care
for the ensuing Sunday&mdash;when he had the satisfaction
of observing the marked and undeviating attention with
which Mr. Gammon sat listening to him; and that candid
inquirer after truth afterwards stepped into the little
vestry and warmly complimented the doctor upon his very
satisfactory and masterly discourse. Thus it was that Dr.
Tatham came to pen a postscript to one of his letters to
Mrs. Aubrey, to which I have formerly alluded, and of
which said postscript the following is a copy:&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"P. S. By the way, the altered state of things at the Hall,
I am of opinion, is entirely owing to the presence and the influence
of a Mr. Gammon&mdash;one of the chief of Mr. Titmouse's
solicitors, and to whom he seems very firmly attached. I have
lived too long in the world to form hasty opinions, and am not
apt to be deceived in my estimate of mankind; but I must say,
I consider Mr. Gammon to be a very superior man, as well in
character and intellect, as in acquirements. He possesses great
acuteness and knowledge of the world, general information, a
very calm and courteous address&mdash;and above and beyond all,
is a man of very enlightened religious feeling. He comes constantly
to church, and presents a truly edifying example to all
around, of decorum and attention. You would be delighted to
hear the discussions we have had on points which my sermons
have suggested to him. He is really an uncommonly acute
man, and I assure you it requires some little logical skill to
contend with him in argument. I preached a sermon lately,
specially aimed at him, which, thank God! I have every reason
to believe has been attended with happy effects, and allayed
some startling doubts which had been for years tormenting
him. I am sure that my dear friend" (<i>i. e.</i> Mr. Aubrey)
"would be delighted with him. I had myself, I assure you,
to overcome a very strong prejudice against him&mdash;a thing I
always love to attempt, and have in a measure, in the present
instance, succeeded. He speaks of you all frequently, with
evident caution, but at the same time with the deepest respect
and sympathy."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>This postscript it was, which, as I have already intimated,
suggested to Mr. Aubrey to seek the interview
with Gammon which has been described, and during
which it was frequently present to his mind.</p>

<p>While, however, under the pressure of Mr. Gammon's
benumbing presence and authority, Titmouse was for a
brief while leading this sober retired life at Yatton&mdash;why,
he hardly knew, except that Gammon willed it&mdash;a
circumstance occurred which suddenly placed him on the
very highest pinnacle of popularity in metropolitan society.
I hardly know how to suppress my feelings of exultation,
in retracing the rapid steps by which Mr. Titmouse was
transformed into a <span class="smcap">Lion</span> of the first magnitude. Be it
known that there was a <span class="smcap">Mr. Bladdery Pip</span>, a fashionable
novelist, possessed of most extraordinary versatility and
power; for he had at the end of every nine months, during
the last nine years, produced a novel in three volumes&mdash;each
succeeding one eclipsing the splendor of its predecessor,
(in the judgment of the accomplished and disinterested
newspaper critics)&mdash;in the "masterly structure
of the plot"&mdash;the "vivid and varied delineation of character"&mdash;the
"profound acquaintance with the workings
of the human heart"&mdash;"exquisite appreciation of life in
all its endless varieties"&mdash;"piercing but delicate satire"&mdash;"bold
and powerful denunciations of popular vices"&mdash;"rich
and tender domestic scenes"&mdash;"inimitable ease
and grace"&mdash;"consummate tact and judgment"&mdash;"reflection
coextensive with observation"&mdash;"the style flowing,
brilliant, nervous, varied, picturesque," <i>et cetera</i>, <i>et
cetera</i>, <i>et cetera</i>. We have, in the present day, thank
Heaven! at least two or three hundred such writers; but
at the time about which I am speaking, Mr. Bladdery Pip
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
was pretty nearly alone in his glory. Such was the man,
to whose trading brain it suddenly occurred, on glancing
over the newspaper report of the trial of <i>Doe on the Demise
of Titmouse</i> v. <i>Jolter</i>, to make the interesting facts of
the case the basis of a new novel, on quite a new plan, and
which was infinitely to transcend all his former works,
and, in fact, occasion quite a revolution in that brilliant
and instructive species of literature! To work went Mr.
Pip, within a day or two after the trial was over, and in
an incredibly short space of time had got to the close of
his labors. Practice had made him perfect, and given him
infinite facility in the production of first-rate writing.
The spirited publisher (Mr. Bubble) then quickly set to
work to "get the steam up"&mdash;but ah! how secretly and
skilfully! For some time there appeared numerous intimations
in the daily papers, that "the circles of ton"
were "on the <i>qui vive</i>" in expectation of a certain forthcoming
work, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;that "disclosures of a very
extraordinary character" were being looked for&mdash;"attempts
had been made to suppress," &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;"compromising
certain distinguished," &amp;c., and so forth; all these
paragraphs being in the unquestionable [!] <i>editorial</i> style,
and <i>genuine</i> [!] indications of a mysterious under-current
of curiosity and excitement, existing in those regions
which were watched with reverential awe and constancy
by the occupants of the lower regions. As time advanced,
more frequent became these titillations of the public palate&mdash;more
distinct these intimations of what was going
forward, and might be shortly expected, from the appearance
of the long-promised work. Take for instance the
following, which ran the round of every newspaper, and
wrought up to a high pitch the curiosity of three-fourths
of the fools in the country:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The efforts made to deprive the public of the interesting
and peculiar scenes contained in the forthcoming novel, and&mdash;in
short&mdash;to suppress it, have entirely failed, owing to the
resolution of the gifted author, and the determination of the
spirited publisher; and their only effect has been to accelerate
the appearance of the work. It will bear the exciting and <i>piquant</i>
title&mdash;'<span class="smcap">Tippetiwink</span>;' and is said to be founded on the
remarkable circumstances attending the recent trial of a great
ejectment cause at York. More than one noble family's history
is believed to be involved in some of the details which will be
found in the forthcoming publication, for which, we are assured,
there are already symptoms of an unprecedented demand. The
'favored few' who have seen it, predict that it will produce a
prodigious sensation. The <i>happy audacity</i> with which facts
are adhered to, will, we trust, not lead to the disagreeable consequences
that appear to be looked for, in certain quarters,
with no little anxiety and dismay. When we announce that
its author is the gifted writer of '<span class="smcap">The Silver Spoons</span>'&mdash;'<span class="smcap">Spinnach</span>'&mdash;'<span class="smcap">The
Pirouette</span>'&mdash;'<span class="smcap">Tittle-Tattle</span>'&mdash;'<span class="smcap">Fitz-Giblets</span>'&mdash;'<span class="smcap">Squint</span>,'
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., we trust we are violating
no literary confidence."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There was no resisting this sort of thing. In that day,
a skilfully directed play of puffs laid prostrate the whole
of the sagacious fashionable world; <i>producing</i> the excitement
of which they affected to chronicle the existence.
The artilleryman, in the present instance, was, in fact, a
hack writer, hired by Mr. Bubble&mdash;in fact, kept by him
entirely&mdash;to perform services of this degrading description&mdash;and
he sat from morning to night in a back-room
on Mr. Bubble's premises, engaged in spinning out these
villanous and lying paragraphs concerning every work published,
or about to be published, by Mr. Bubble. Then
that gentleman hit upon another admirable device. He
had seven hundred copies printed off; and allowing a hundred
for a <i>first</i> edition, he varied the title-pages of each
of the remaining six hundred by the words: "<i>Second</i> Edition"&mdash;"<i>Third</i>
Edition"&mdash;"<i>Fourth</i> Edition"&mdash;"<i>Fifth</i>
Edition"&mdash;"<i>Sixth</i> Edition"&mdash;and "<i>Seventh</i> Edition."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>By the time, however, that the fourth edition had been
announced, there existed a real rage for the book. The
circulating libraries at the West End of the town were
besieged by applicants for a perusal of the work; and
"notices," "reviews," and "extracts," began to make their
appearance with increasing frequency in the newspapers.
The idea of the work was admirable. <i>Tippetiwink</i>, the
hero, was a young gentleman of ancient family&mdash;an only
child&mdash;kidnapped away in his infancy by the malignant
agency of "the demon <i>Mowbray</i>," a distant relative, of a
fierce temper and wicked character, who by these means
had succeeded to the enjoyment of the estate, and would
have come, in time, to the honors and domains of the
most ancient and noble family in the kingdom, that of
the <i>Earl of Frizzleton</i>. Poor Tippetiwink was at length,
however, discovered by his illustrious kinsman, by mere
accident, in an obscure capacity, in the employ of a benevolent
linen-draper, <i>Black-bag</i>, who was described as one
of the most amiable and generous of linen-drapers; and,
after a series of wonderful adventures, in which the hero
displayed the most heroic constancy, the earl succeeded
in reinstating his oppressed and injured kinsman in the
lofty station which he ought always to have occupied. His
daughter&mdash;a paragon of female loveliness&mdash;the <i>Lady Sapphira
Sigh-away</i>&mdash;evinced the deepest interest in the success
of <i>Tippetiwink</i>; and at length&mdash;the happy result may
be guessed by the astute and experienced novel-reader.
Out of these few and natural incidents, Mr. Bladdery Pip
was pronounced at length, by those (<i>i. e.</i> the aforesaid
newspaper scribes) who govern, if they do not indeed constitute,
<small>PUBLIC OPINION</small>, to have produced an imperishable
record of his genius; avoiding all the faults, and combining
all the excellences, of all his former productions. The identity
between Titmouse and <i>Tippetiwink</i>, Lord Dreddlington
and <i>Lord Frizzleton</i>, Lady Cecilia and <i>Lady Sapphira</i>,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
and Mr. Aubrey and the "<i>demon Mowbray</i>," was quickly
established. The novel passed speedily into the <i>tenth edition</i>!
An undoubted, and a very great sensation was produced;
extracts descriptive of the persons, particularly
that of Titmouse, and the earl, and Lady Cecilia, figuring
in the story, were given in the London papers, and thence
transferred into those all over the country. The very author
of the book, Mr. Bladdery Pip, became a prodigious
<small>LION</small>, and dressing himself in the most elaborate and
exquisite style, had his portrait, looking most intensely
intellectual, prefixed to the tenth edition. Then came
portraits of "Tittlebat Titmouse, Esq.," (for which he
had never sat,) giving him large melting eyes, a very
pensive face, and a most fashionable appearance. The
Earl of Dreddlington and Lady Cecilia became also a lion
and lioness. Hundreds of opera-glasses were directed, at
once, to their opera-box; innumerable were the anxious
salutations they received as they drove round the Park&mdash;and
round it they went three or four times as often as
they had ever done before. 'Twas whispered that the
king had read the book, and drank the earl's health,
under the name of Lord Frizzleton&mdash;while the queen
did the same for Lady Cecilia as Lady Sapphira. Their
appearance produced a manifest sensation at both the levee
and drawing-room.&mdash;Majesty looked blander than usual as
they approached. Poor Lord Dreddlington, and Lady Cecilia,
mounted in a trice into the seventh heaven of rapturous
excitement; for there was that buoyant quality about
their heads which secured them a graceful and rapid upward
motion. They were both unutterably <i>happy</i>; living
in a gentle delicious tumult of exalted feeling. Irrepressible
exultation glistened in the earl's eyes; he threw an infinite
deal of blandness and courtesy into his manners wherever
he was, and whomsoever he addressed; as if he could
now easily afford it, confident in the inaccessible sublimity
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
of his position. It was slightly laughable to observe, however,
the desperate efforts he made to maintain his former
frigid composure of manner&mdash;but in vain; his nervousness
looked almost like a sudden, though gentle accession
of St. Vitus's dance. Innumerable were the inquiries after
Titmouse&mdash;his person&mdash;his manners&mdash;his character&mdash;his
dress, made of Lady Cecilia by her friends. Young
ladies tormented her for his autograph. 'T was with her
as if the level surface of the Dead Sea had been stirred
by the freshening breeze.</p>

<p>When a thing of this sort is once fairly set going,
where is it to end? When fashion does go mad, her
madness is wonderful; and she very soon turns the world
mad. Presently the young men appeared everywhere in
black satin stocks, embroidered, some with flowers, and
others with gold, and which went by the name of "<i>Titmouse-Ties</i>;"
and in hats, with high crowns and rims a
quarter of an inch in depth, called "<i>Tittlebats</i>." All the
young blades about town, especially the clerks and shopmen
in the city, dressed themselves in the most extravagant
style; an amazing impetus was given to the cigar trade&mdash;whose
shops were crowded, especially at nights; and
every puppy that walked the streets puffed cigar-smoke
in your eyes. In short, pert and lively <i>Titmice</i> might be
seen hopping about the streets in all directions. As for Tag-rag,
wonders befell him. A paragraph in a paper pointed
him out as the original of <i>Black-bag</i>, and his shop in Oxford
Street as the scene of Titmouse's service. Thither
quickly poured the tide of fashionable curiosity, and custom.
His business was soon trebled. He wore his best
clothes every day, and smirked and smiled, and bustled
about amid the crowd in his shop, in a perfect fever of
excitement. He began to think of buying the adjoining
premises, and adding them to his own; and set his name
down as a subscriber of a guinea a-year to the "Decayed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Drapers' Association." Those were glorious times for Mr.
Tag-rag. He was forced to engage a dozen extra hands;
there were seldom less than fifty or a hundred persons in
his shop at once; strings of carriages stood before his door,
sometimes two deep, and continual strugglings occurred
between the coachmen for precedence. In fact, Mr. Tag-rag
believed that the <span class="smcap">Millennium</span> (about which he had
often heard wonders from Mr. Dismal Horror, who, it
seemed, knew all about it&mdash;a fact of which he had first
persuaded his congregation, <i>and then himself</i>) was coming
in earnest.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>The undulations of the popular excitement in town, were
not long in reaching the calm retreat of Mr. Titmouse in
Yorkshire. To say nothing of his having on several occasions
observed artists busily engaged in sketching different
views of the Hall and its surrounding scenery,
and, on inquiry, discovered that they had been sent from
London for the express purpose of presenting to the
excited public sketches of the "residence of Mr. Titmouse,"
a copy of the inimitable performance of Mr.
Bladdery Pip&mdash;viz. "<span class="smcap">Tippetiwink</span>," (tenth edition) was
sent down to Mr. Titmouse by Gammon; who also forwarded
to him, from time to time, newspapers containing
those paragraphs which identified Titmouse with the
hero of the novel, and also testified the profound impression
which it was making upon the thinking classes of
the community. Was Titmouse's wish to witness the
ferment he had so unconsciously produced in the metropolis,
unreasonable? Yatton was beginning to look
duller daily, even before the arrival of this stimulating
intelligence from town; Titmouse feeling quite out of
his element. So&mdash;Gammon <i>non contradicente</i>&mdash;up came
Titmouse to town. If he had not been naturally a fool,
the notice he attracted in London must soon have made
him one. He had been for coming up in a post-chaise
and four; but Gammon, in a letter, succeeded in dissuading
him from incurring so useless an expense, assuring
him that men of even as high consideration as himself,
constantly availed themselves of the safe and rapid transit
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
afforded by the royal mail. His valet, on being appealed
to, corroborated Mr. Gammon's representations;
adding, that the late hour in the evening at which that
respectable vehicle arrived in town would effectually
shroud him from public observation. Giving strict and
repeated orders to his valet to deposit him at once "in
a first-rate West-End hotel," the haughty lord of Yatton,
plentifully provided with cigars, stepped into the
mail, his valet perching himself upon the box-seat. That
gifted functionary was well acquainted with town, and
resolved on his master's taking up his quarters at the
Harcourt Hotel, in the immediate vicinity of Bond
Street.</p>

<p>The mail passed the Peacock, at Islington, about half-past
eight o'clock; and long before they had reached
even that point, the eager and anxious eye of Titmouse
had been on the look-out for indications of his celebrity.
He was, however, compelled to own that both people and
places seemed much as usual&mdash;wearing no particular air
of excitement. At this he was a little chagrined, till he
reflected on the vulgar ignorance of the movements of the
great, for which the eastern regions of the metropolis were
proverbial, and also on the increasing duskiness of the
evening, the rapid pace at which the mail rattled along,
and the circumstance of his being concealed inside. When
his humble hackney-coach (its driver a feeble old man,
with a wisp of straw for a hat-band, and sitting on the
rickety box like a heap of dirty old clothes, and the flagging
and limping horses looking truly miserable objects)
had rumbled slowly up to the lofty and gloomy door of
the Harcourt Hotel, it seemed to excite no notice whatever.
A tall waiter, in a plain suit of black evening dress, with
his hands stuck behind his coat-tails, continued standing
in the ample doorway, eying the plebeian vehicle which
had drawn up, with utter indifference&mdash;conjecturing,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
probably, that it had come to the wrong door. With
the same air of provoking superciliousness he stood till
the valet, having jumped down from his seat beside the
driver, ran up, and in a peremptory sort of way exclaimed,
"<span class="smcap">Mr. Titmouse</span> of Yatton!" This stirred the waiter into
something like energy.</p>

<p>"Here, sir!" called out Mr. Titmouse from within the
coach; and on the waiter's slowly approaching, the former
inquired of him in a sufficiently swaggering manner&mdash;"Pray,
has the <i>Earl of Dreddlington</i> been inquiring
for me here to-day?" The words seemed to operate like
magic; converting the person addressed, in a moment,
into a slave&mdash;supple and obsequious.</p>

<p>"His Lordship has not been here to-day, sir," he replied
in a low tone, with a most courteous inclination,
gently opening the door, and noiselessly letting down the
steps. "Do you alight, sir?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;a&mdash;have you room for me, and my <i>fellow</i>
there?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir! certainly.&mdash;Shall I show you into the
coffee-room, sir?"</p>

<p>"The coffee-room? Curse the coffee-room, sir! Demme,
sir, do you suppose I'm a commercial traveller? Show
me into a private room, sir!" The waiter bowed low;
and in silent surprise led Mr. Titmouse to a very spacious
and elegantly-furnished apartment&mdash;where, amid the
blaze of six wax candles, and attended by three waiters,
he supped, an hour or two afterwards, in great state&mdash;retiring
about eleven o'clock to his apartment, overcome
with fatigue&mdash;and brandy and water: having fortunately
escaped the indignity of being forced to sit in the room
where an English nobleman, two or three county members,
and a couple of foreign princes, were sitting sipping
their claret, some writing letters, and others conning over
the evening papers. About noon, the next day, he called
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
upon the Earl of Dreddlington; and though, under ordinary
circumstances, his Lordship would have considered
the visit rather unseasonable, he nevertheless received
his fortunate and now truly distinguished kinsman with
the most urbane cordiality. At the earl's suggestion,
and with Mr. Gammon's concurrence, Titmouse, within
about a week after his arrival in town, took a set of
chambers in the Albany, together with the elegant furniture
which had belonged to their late tenant, a distinguished
fashionable, who had shortly before suddenly
gone abroad upon a mission of great importance&mdash;<i>to
himself</i>: viz. to avoid his creditors. Mr. Titmouse soon
began to feel, in various ways, the distinction which was
attached to his name&mdash;commencing, as he did at once,
the gay and brilliant life of a man of high fashion, and
under the august auspices of the Earl of Dreddlington.
Like as a cat, shod with walnut-shells by some merry
young scapegrace, doubtless feels more and more astounded
at the clatter it makes in scampering up and
down the bare echoing floors and staircases; so, in some
sort, was it with Titmouse, in respect of the sudden and
amazing <i>éclat</i> with which all his appearances and movements
were attended in the regions of fashion. 'Tis a
matter of indifference to a fool, whether you laugh <i>with</i>
him or <i>at</i> him; so as that you do but laugh&mdash;an observation
which will account for much of the conduct both
of Lord Dreddlington and Titmouse. In this short life,
and dull world, the thing is&mdash;to create a <i>sensation</i>, never
mind how; and every opportunity of doing so should be
gratefully seized hold of, and improved to the uttermost,
by those who have nothing else to do, and have an inclination
to distinguish themselves from the common herd
of mankind, and show that they have not lived in vain.
Lord Dreddlington had got so inflated by the attention
he excited, that he set down everything he witnessed to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the score of deference and admiration. His self-conceit
was so intense, that it consumed every vestige of sense
he had about him. He stood in solitary grandeur upon
the lofty pillar of his pride, inaccessible to ridicule, and
insensible indeed of its approach, like <i>vanity</i> "on a monument
smiling at" <i>scorn</i>. Indeed,</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His soul was like a star, and dwelt apart."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He did not conceive it possible for any one to laugh at
<i>him</i>, or anything he might choose to do, or any one he
might think fit to associate with and introduce to the
notice of society&mdash;which kind office he forthwith performed
for Titmouse, to whose odd person, and somewhat
eccentric dress and demeanor, his Lordship (who imagined
that the same operation was going on in the minds of
other people) was growing daily more reconciled. Thus,
that which had at first so shocked his Lordship, he got at
length perfectly familiar and satisfied with, and began to
suspect whether it had not been assumed by Titmouse,
out of a daring scorn for the intrusive opinions of the
world, which showed a loftiness of spirit akin to his Lordship's
own. Besides, in another point of view&mdash;suppose
the manner and appearance of Titmouse were ever so
absurd, so long as his Lordship chose to tolerate them,
who should venture to gainsay them? So the earl asked
him frequently to dinner; took him with them when his
Lordship and Lady Cecilia went out in the evenings;
gave him a seat in his carriage in going down to the
House; and invited him to accompany him and Lady
Cecilia when they either drove or rode round the Park.
As for the matter of riding, Titmouse's assiduous attention
at the riding-school, enabled him to appear on horseback
without being <i>glaringly</i> unequal to the management
of his horse, which, however, he more than once induced
to back somewhat threateningly upon those of Lady Cecilia
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
and the earl. Titmouse happening to let fall, at
the earl's table, that he had that day ordered an elegant
chariot to be built for him, his Lordship intimated that
a cab was the usual turn-out of a bachelor man of fashion;
whereupon Titmouse the next day countermanded his
order, and was fortunate enough to secure a cab which
had just been completed for a young nobleman who was
unable to pay for it, and whom, consequently, the builder
did not care about disappointing. He soon provided himself
with a great horse and a little tiger. What pen can
do justice to the feelings with which he first sat down
in that cab, yielding upon its thoroughly well-balanced
springs, took the reins from his little tiger, and then heard
him jump up behind! As it was a trifle too early for
the Park, he suddenly bethought himself of exhibiting
his splendors before the establishment of Mr. Tag-rag;
so he desired his little imp behind to run and summon
his valet, who in a trice came down; and in answer to a
question, "whether there wasn't something wanting from
a draper or hosier," was informed glibly, that six dozen
of best cambric pocket handkerchiefs, a dozen or two pair
of white kid gloves, half-a-dozen stocks, and various other
items were "wanting"&mdash;(<i>i. e.</i> by the valet himself, for
Titmouse was already profusely provided with these articles.)
Off, however, he drove&mdash;occupied with but one
idea&mdash;and succeeded, at length, in reaching the Oxford
Street establishment, before the door of which five or six
carriages were standing. I should say that, at the moment
of Mr. Titmouse's strutting into that scene of his
former miserable servitude, he experienced a gush of
delight sufficient to have effaced all recollection of the
wretchedness, privation, and oppression, endured in his
early days. There was presently an evident flutter among
the gentlemen engaged behind the counter&mdash;for, thought
they&mdash;it must be "the great Mr. Titmouse!" Mr. Tag-rag,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
catching sight of him, bounced out of his little room,
and bustled up to him through the crowd of customers,
bowing, scraping, blushing, and rubbing his hands, full of
pleasurable excitement, and exhibiting the most profound
obsequiousness. "Hope you're well, sir," he commenced
in a low tone, but instantly added, in a louder voice, observing
that Mr. Titmouse chose to appear to have come
merely upon business, "what can I have the honor to do
for you, sir, this morning?" And handing him a stool,
Tag-rag, with a respectful air, received a very liberal order
from Mr. Titmouse, and called for a shopman to make a
minute of the precious words which fell from the lips of
Mr. Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Dear me, sir, is that your cab?" said Tag-rag, as,
having accompanied Titmouse, bowing at every step, to
the door, they both stood there for a moment, "I never
saw such a beautiful turn-out in my life, sir"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ya&mdash;a&mdash;s. Pretty well&mdash;pretty well; but that
young rascal of mine's dirtied one of his boots a little&mdash;dem
him!" and he looked terrors at the tiger.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!&mdash;so he has; shall I wipe it off, sir? <i>Do</i>
let one of my young men"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, it don't signify much. By the way, Mr. Tag-rag,"
added Mr. Titmouse, in a drawling way, "all well
at&mdash;at&mdash;demme if I've not, at this moment, forgot the
name of your place in the country"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Satin Lodge, sir," said Tag-rag, meekly, but with infinite
inward uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ay, to be sure. One sees, 'pon my soul, such
a lot of places&mdash;but&mdash;eh?&mdash;all well?"</p>

<p>"All very well, indeed, sir; and constantly talking of
you, sir," replied Tag-rag, with an earnestness amounting
to intensity.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;well! My compliments&mdash;" here he drew on
his second glove, and moved towards his cab, Tag-rag
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
accompanying him&mdash;"glad they're well. If ever I'm
driving that way&mdash;good-day!" In popped Titmouse&mdash;up
jumped his tiger behind&mdash;crack went his whip&mdash;and
away darted the horse and splendid vehicle&mdash;Tag-rag
following it with an admiring and anxious eye.</p>

<p>As Mr. Titmouse sat in his cab, on his way to the
Park, dressed in the extreme of the mode; his glossy hat
perched sideways on his bushy, well-oiled, but somewhat
mottled hair; his surtout lined with velvet; his full satin
stock, spangled with inwrought gold flowers, and ornamented
with two splendid pins, connected together with
delicate double gold chains; his shirt-collar turned down
over his stock; his chased gold eyeglass stuck in his right
eye; the stiff wristbands of his shirt turned back over
his coat-cuffs; and his red hands concealed in snowy kid
gloves, holding his whip and reins with graceful ease:
when he considered the exquisite figure he must thus
present to the eye of all beholders, and gave them credit
for gazing at him with the same sort of feelings which
similar sights had, but a few months before, excited in
<i>his</i> despairing breast, his little cup of happiness was full,
and even brimming over. This, though I doubt whether
it was a just reflection, was still a very natural one; for
he knew what his own feelings were, though not how
weak and absurd they were; and of course judged of
others by himself. If the Marquis of Whigborough, with
his £200,000 a-year, and 5,000 independent voters at his
command, had been on his way down to the House, absorbed
with anxiety as to the effect of the final threat he
was going to make to the Minister, that, unless he had a
few strawberry leaves promised him, he should feel it his
duty to record his vote against the great <span class="smcap">Bill</span> for "<i>Giving
Everybody Everything</i>," which stood for a third reading
that evening; or the great Duke of &mdash;&mdash;, a glance of
whose eye, or a wave of whose hand, was sufficient to have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
lit up an European war, and who might at that moment
have been balancing in his mind the fate of millions of
mankind, as depending upon his <i>fiat</i> for peace or war:&mdash;I
say, that if both, or either of these personages, had
passed or met Mr. Titmouse, in their cabs, (which they
were mechanically urging onward, so absorbed the while
with their own thoughts, that they scarce knew whether
they were in a cab or a handbarrow, in which latter, had
it been before their gates, either of them might, in his
abstraction, have seated himself;) Titmouse's superior
acquaintance with human nature assured him, that the
sight of his tip-top turn-out, could not fail of attracting
their attention, and nettling their pride. Whether Milton,
if cast on a desolate island, but with the means of writing
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, would have done so, had he been certain
that no human eye would ever peruse a line of it; or
whether Mr. Titmouse, had he been suddenly deposited
in his splendid cab, in the midst of the desert of Sahara,
with not one of his species to fix an envying eye upon
him, would nevertheless have experienced a great measure
of satisfaction, I am not prepared to say. As, however,
every condition of life has its mixture of good and evil, so,
if Titmouse had been placed in the midst of the aforesaid
desert at the time when he was last before the reader, instead
of dashing along Oxford Street, he would have escaped
certain difficulties and dangers which he presently
encountered. Had an ape, not acquainted with the science
of driving, been put into Titmouse's place, he would
probably have driven much in the same style, though he
would have had greatly the advantage over his rival in
respect of his simple and natural appearance; being, to
the eye of correct taste, "when unadorned, adorned the
most." Mr. Titmouse, in spite of the assistance to his
sight which he derived from his <i>neutral</i><a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> glass, was continually
coming into collision with the vehicles which met
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
and passed him, on his way to Cumberland Gate. He
got into no fewer than four distinct <i>rows</i> (to say nothing
of the flying curses which he received in passing) between
the point which I have named, and Mr. Tag-rag's premises.
But as he was by no means destitute of spirit, he sat in
his cab, on these four occasions, cursing and blaspheming
like a little fiend; till he almost brought tears of vexation
into the eyes of one or two of his opponents, (cads,
cab-drivers, watermen, hackney-coachmen, carters, stage-coachmen,
market-gardeners, and draymen,) who unexpectedly
found their own weapon&mdash;<i>i. e. slang</i>&mdash;wielded
with such superior power and effect, for once in a way,
by a swell&mdash;an aristocrat. The more manly of his opponents
were filled with secret respect for the possessor of
such unsuspected powers. Still it was unpleasant for a
person of Mr. Titmouse's distinction to be engaged in
these conflicts; and he would have given the world to
have conquered his conceit so far as to summon his little
tiger within, and surrender to him the reins. Such a
ridiculous confession of his own incapacity, however, he
could not think of, and he got into several little disturbances
in the Park; after which he drove home: the battered
cab had to be taken to the maker's, where the
injuries it had sustained were repaired, however, for the
trifling sum of forty pounds.</p>

<p>The position obtained for Titmouse by the masterly
genius of Mr. Bladdery Pip, was secured and strengthened
by much more substantial claims upon the respect of
society than those derived from literary genius. Rumor
is a dame always looking at objects through very strong
magnifying-glasses; and who, guided by what she saw,
soon gave out that Titmouse was patron of three boroughs;
had a clear rent-roll of thirty thousand a-year;
and had already received nearly a hundred thousand
pounds in hard cash from the previous proprietor of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
estates, as a compensation for the back rents, which that
usurper had been for so many years in the receipt of.
Then he was&mdash;in truth and fact&mdash;very near in succession
to the ancient and distinguished Barony of Drelincourt,
and the extensive estates thereto annexed. He was
young; by no means ill-looking; and was&mdash;unmarried.
Under the mask of <i>naïveté</i> and eccentricity, it was believed
that he concealed great natural acuteness, for the purpose
of ascertaining who were his real and who only his pretended
friends and well-wishers, and that his noble relatives
had given in to his little scheme, for the purpose of
aiding him in the important discovery upon which he was
bent. Infinite effect was thus given to the earl's introductions.
Wherever Titmouse went, he found new and
delightful acquaintances; and invitations to dinners, balls,
routs, soirées, came showering daily into his rooms at the
Albany, where also were left innumerable cards, bearing
names of very high fashion. All who had daughters or
sisters in the market, paid eager and persevering court to
Mr. Titmouse, and still more so to the Earl of Dreddlington
and Lady Cecilia, his august <i>sponsors</i>; so that&mdash;such
being the will of that merry jade Fortune&mdash;they who had
once regarded him as an object only of shuddering disgust
and ineffable contempt, and had been disposed to order
their servants to show him out again into the streets, were
now, in a manner, <i>magnified and made honorable</i> by means
of their connection with him; or rather, society, through
his means, had become suddenly sensible of the commanding
qualities and pretensions of the Earl of Dreddlington
and the Lady Cecilia. In the ball-room&mdash;at Almack's
even&mdash;how many young men, handsome, accomplished,
and of the highest personal consequence and rank, applied
in vain for the hand of haughty beauty, which Mr. Titmouse
had only to ask for, and obtain! Whose was the
opera-box into which he might not drop as a welcome visitor,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
and be seen lounging in envied familiarity with its
fair and brilliant inmates? Were there not mothers of
high fashion, of stately pride, of sounding rank, who would
have humbled themselves before Titmouse, if thereby he
could have been brought a suitor to the feet of one of
their delicate and beautiful daughters? But it was not
over the fair sex alone that the magic of Mr. Titmouse's
name and pretensions had obtained this great and sudden
ascendency; he excited no small attention among men of
fashion&mdash;great numbers of whom quickly recognized in
him one very fit to become their butt and their dupe.
What signified it to men secure of their own position in
society, that they were seen openly associating with one
so outrageously absurd in his dress&mdash;and vulgar and ignorant
beyond all example? So long as he bled freely,
and "<i>trotted out</i>," briskly and willingly, his eccentricities
could be not merely tolerated, but humored. Take, for
instance, the gay and popular <span class="smcap">Marquis Gants-Jaunes de
Millefleurs</span>; but he is worth a word or two of description,
because of the position he had contrived to acquire
and retain, and the influence which he managed to exercise
over a considerable portion of London society. The
post he was anxious to secure was that of the leader of
<i>ton</i>; and he wished it to appear that that was the sole
object of his ambition. While, however, he affected to be
entirely engrossed by such matters as devising new and
exquisite variations of dress, equipage, and cookery, he was,
in reality, bent upon graver pursuits&mdash;upon gratifying his
own licentious tastes and inclinations, with secrecy and impunity.
He really despised <i>folly</i>, cultivating and practising
only <i>vice</i>; in which he was, in a manner, an epicure. He
was now about his forty-second year; had been handsome;
was of bland and fascinating address; variously accomplished;
of exquisite tact; of most refined taste. There
was, however, a slight fulness and puffiness about his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
features&mdash;an expression in his eye which spoke of <i>satiety</i>&mdash;and
spoke truly. He was a very proud, selfish, heartless
person; but these qualities he contrived to disguise
from many of even his most intimate associates. An object
of constant anxiety to him, was to ingratiate himself with
the younger and weaker branches of the aristocracy, in order
to secure a distinguished <i>status</i> in society, and he succeeded.
To gain this point, he taxed all his resources; never were
so exquisitely blended, as in his instance, with a view to
securing his <i>influence</i>, the qualities of dictator and parasite:
he always appeared the <i>agreeable equal</i> of those
whom, for his life, he dared not seriously have offended.
He had no fortune; no visible means of making money&mdash;did
not sensibly sponge upon his friends, nor fall into
conspicuous embarrassments; yet he always lived in luxury.&mdash;Without
money, he in some inconceivable manner
always contrived to be in the possession of money's worth.
He had a magical power of soothing querulous tradesmen.
He had a knack of always keeping himself, his <i>clique</i>, his
sayings and doings, before the eye of the public, in such
a manner as to satisfy it that he was the acknowledged
leader of fashion. Yet was it in truth no such thing&mdash;but
only a <i>false</i> fashion; there being all the difference
between him, and a man of real consequence, in society,
that there is between mock and real pearl&mdash;between paste
and diamond. It was true that young men of sounding
name and title were ever to be found in his train, thereby
giving real countenance to one from whom they fancied
(till they found out their mistake) that they themselves
derived celebrity; thus enabling him to effect a lodgement
in the outskirts of aristocracy; but he could not
penetrate inland, so to speak, any more than foreign
merchants can advance farther than to Canton, in the
dominions of the Emperor of China.<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> He was only tolerated
in the regions of real rank and fashion&mdash;a fact of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
which he had a very galling consciousness; though it did
not, apparently, disturb his equanimity, or interrupt the
systematic and refined sycophancy by which alone he
could secure his precarious position.</p>

<p>With some sad exceptions, I think that Great Britain
has reason to be proud of her aristocracy. I do not speak
now of those gaudy flaunting personages, of either sex,
who, by their excesses or eccentricities, are eternally obtruding
themselves, their manners, dress, and equipage,
upon the offended ear and eye of the public; but of those
who occupy their exalted sphere in simplicity, in calmness,
and in unobtrusive dignity and virtue. I am no
flatterer or idolater of the nobility. I have a profound
sense of the necessity and advantage of the <i>institution</i>:
but I shall ever pay its <i>members</i>, personally, an honest
homage only, after a stern and keen scrutiny into their
personal pretensions; thinking of them ever in the spirit
of those memorable words of Scripture&mdash;"<i>Unto whomsoever
much is given, of him shall be much required</i>," and that
not hereafter only, but <small>HERE</small> also. No one would visit
their faults and follies with a more unsparing severity
than I; yet making all just allowances for their peculiar
perils and temptations, exposed, as they are, especially at
the period of their entrance upon life, to sedulous and
systematic sycophancy, too often also to artful and designing
profligacy. Can, however, anything excite greater
indignation and disgust in the mind of a thoughtful and
independent observer than the instances occasionally exhibited
of persons of rank presumptuously imagining
that they enjoy a sort of prescriptive immunity from
the consequences of misconduct? An insolent or profligate
nobleman is a spectacle becoming every day more
dangerous to exhibit in this country; of that he may
be assured.</p>

<p>Such are <i>my</i> sentiments&mdash;those of a contented member
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
of the middle classes, with whom are all his best and
dearest sympathies, and who feels as stern a pride in his
"Order," and determination to "<i>stand by it</i>" too, as ever
was felt or avowed by the haughtiest aristocrat for <i>his</i>;
of one who, with very little personal acquaintance with
the aristocracy, has yet had opportunities of observing
their conduct; and sincerely and cheerfully expresses his
belief, that very, very many of them are worthy of all that
they enjoy&mdash;are bright patterns of honor, generosity, loyalty,
and virtue; that, indeed, of by far the greater proportion
of them it may be said that they</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Have borne their faculties so meek&mdash;have been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So clear in their great office, that their virtues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will plead like angels."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And finally, I say these are the sentiments of one who, if
that Order were in jeopardy, would, with the immense
majority of his brethren of the middle classes, freely
shed his blood in defence of it: for its preservation is
essential to the well-being of society, and its privileges
are really ours.</p>

<p>To return, however, to the marquis. The means to
which, as I have above explained, he resorted for the purpose,
secured him a certain species of permanent popularity.
In matters of dress and equipage, he could really
set the fashion; and being something of a practical humorist,
and desirous of frequent exhibitions of his influence
in order to enhance his pretensions with his patrons&mdash;and
being also greatly applauded and indulged by the
tradespeople profiting by the vagaries of fashion, he was
very capricious in the exercise of his influence. He seized
the opportunity of the advent of my little hero, to display
his powers very advantageously. He waved his wand over
Titmouse, and instantly transformed a little ass into a
great lion. 'Twas the marquis, who with his own hand
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
had sketched off, from fancy, the portrait of Titmouse,
causing it to be exhibited in almost every bookseller's shop-window.
Well knew the marquis, that had he chosen to
make his appearance once or twice in the parks, and leading
streets and squares, in&mdash;for instance&mdash;the full and
imposing evening costume of the clown at the theatre,
with cunningly colored countenance, capacious white inexpressibles,
and tasteful cap and jacket&mdash;within a few
days' time several thousands of clowns would make their
appearance about town, turning it into a vast pantomime.
Could a more striking instance of the marquis's power in
such matters have been exhibited, than that which had
actually occurred in the case of Titmouse? Soon after
the novel of Tippetiwink had rendered our friend an object
of public interest, the marquis happened, somewhere or
other, to catch a glimpse of the preposterous little ape.
His keen eye caught all Titmouse's personal peculiarities
at a glance; and a day or two afterwards he appeared
in public, a sort of splendid edition of Titmouse&mdash;with
quizzing-glass stuck in his eye and cigar in his mouth;
taper ebony cane; tight surtout, with the snowy corner
of a white handkerchief peeping out of the outside breast-pocket;
hat with scarce any rim perched slantingly on
his head; satin stock bespangled with inwrought gold
flowers; shirt-collar turned down; and that inimitable
strut of his!&mdash;'Twas enough; the thoughtful young men
about town were staggered for a moment; but their senses
soon returned. <i>The marquis</i> had stamped the thing with
his fiat; and within three days' time, that bitter wag
had called forth a flight of <i>Titmice</i> which would have reminded
you, for a moment, of the visitation of locusts
brought upon Egypt by Moses. Thus had been effected
the state of things, recorded towards the close of the preceding
chapter of this history. As soon as the marquis
had seen a few of the leading fools about town fairly in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the fashion, he resumed his former rigid simplicity of
attire; and, accompanied by a friend or two in his confidence,
walked about the town enjoying his triumph;
witnessing his trophies&mdash;"Tittlebats" and "Titmouseties"
filling the shop-windows on the week-days, and peopling
the streets on Sundays. The marquis was not long
in obtaining an introduction to the quaint little <i>millionaire</i>,
whose reputation he had, conjointly with his distinguished
friend Mr. Bladdery Pip, contributed so greatly
to extend. Titmouse, who had often heard of him, looked
upon him with inconceivable reverence, and accepted an
invitation to one of the marquis's <i>recherché</i> Sunday dinners,
with a sort of tremulous ecstasy. Thither on the
appointed day he went accordingly, and, by his original
humor, afforded infinite amusement to the marquis's other
guests. 'Twas lucky for Titmouse that, getting dreadfully
drunk very early in the evening, he was utterly
incapacitated from accompanying his brilliant and good-natured
host to one or two scenes of fashionable entertainment,
in St. James's Street, as had been arranged
between the marquis and a few of his friends!</p>

<p>Let us pause now to ask whether this poor little creature
was not to be pitied? Did he not seem to have been
plucked out of his own sphere of safe and comparatively
happy obscurity, only in order to become every one's game&mdash;an
object of everybody's cupidity and cruelty? May
he not be compared to the flying-fish, who, springing out
of the water to avoid his deadly pursuer there, is instantly
pounced upon by his ravenous assailants in the air? In
the lower, and in the upper regions of society, was not
this the condition of poor Tittlebat Titmouse? Was not
his long-coveted advancement merely a transition from
scenes of vulgar to refined rapacity? Had he, ever since
"<i>luck</i> had happened to him," had one single <i>friend</i> to
whisper in his ear one word of pity and of disinterested
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
counsel? In the splendid regions which he had entered,
who regarded him otherwise than as a legitimate object
for plunder or ridicule, the latter disguised by the <i>designing</i>
only? Was not even his dignified and exemplary old
kinsman, the Earl of Dreddlington, Right Honorable as
he was, influenced solely by considerations of paltry self-interest?
Had he not his own ridiculous and mercenary
designs to accomplish, amid all the attentions he vouchsafed
to bestow upon Titmouse? 'Twas, I think, old
Hobbes of Malmesbury who held, that the natural state
of mankind was one of war with each other. One really
sees a good deal in life, especially after tracing the progress
of society, that would seem to give some color to so
strange a notion. 'Twas, of course, at first a matter of
downright fisticuffs&mdash;of physical strife, occasioned, in a
great measure, by our natural tendencies, according to
him of Malmesbury; and aggravated by the desire which
everybody had, to take away from everybody else what
he had. In process of time we have, in a measure,
dropped the physical part of the business; and instead of
punching, scratching, kicking, biting, and knocking down
one another, still true to the original principles of our nature,
we are all endeavoring to circumvent one another:
everybody is trying to take everybody in; the moment
that one of us has got together a thing or two, he is
pounced upon by his neighbor, who in his turn falls a
prey to another, and so on in endless succession. We
cannot effectually help ourselves, though we are splitting
our heads to discover devices by way of laws, to restrain
this propensity of our nature: it will not do; we are all
overreaching, cheating, swindling, robbing one another,
and, if necessary, are ready to ruin, maim, and murder
one another in the prosecution of our designs. So is it
with nations as with individuals, and minor collections
of individuals. Truly, truly, we are a precious set,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
whether the sage of Malmesbury be right or wrong in
his speculations!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The more that the earl and Lady Cecilia perceived of
Titmouse's popularity, the more eager were they in parading
their connection with him, and openly investing him
with the character of a protégé. In addition to this, the
Lady Cecilia had begun to have now and then a glimmering
notion of the objects which the earl was contemplating.
If the earl, having taken him down to the House of
Lords, and secured him a place at the bar, would, immediately
on entering, walk up to him, and be seen for some
time&mdash;august instructor!&mdash;condescendingly pointing out
to him the different peers by name, as they entered, and
explaining to his intelligent auditor the period, and mode,
and cause, of the creation and accession of many of them
to their honors, and also the forms, ceremonies, and routine
of business in the House; so Lady Cecilia was not
remiss in availing herself, in her way, of the little opportunities
which presented themselves. She invited him,
for instance, one day early in the week, to accompany
them to church on the ensuing Sunday, and during the
interval gave out among her intimate friends that they
might expect to see Mr. Titmouse in her papa's pew. The
lion accepted the invitation; and, on the arrival of the
appointed hour, might have been seen in the earl's carriage,
driving to attend the afternoon's service, at the
Reverend <span class="smcap">Morphine Velvet's</span> chapel&mdash;<i>Rosemary</i> Chapel,
near St. James's Square. 'Twas a fashionable chapel; a
chapel <i>of Ease</i>: rightly so called, for it was a very <i>easy</i>
mode of worship, discipline, and doctrine that was there
practised and inculcated. If I may adopt without irreverence
the language of Scripture, but apply it very differently,
I should say that Mr. Morphine Velvet's yoke
was <i>very</i> "easy," his burden <i>very</i> "light." He was a
popular preacher; middle-aged; sleek, serene, solemn in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
his person and demeanor. He had a very gentlemanlike
appearance in the pulpit and reading-desk. There was a
sort of soothing, winning elegance and tenderness in the
tone and manner in which he "<i>prayed</i>" and "<i>besought</i>" his
"dearly beloved brethren, as many as were there present,
to accompany him," their bland and graceful pastor, "to
the throne of the heavenly grace!" Fit leader was he of
such a flock. He read the prayers remarkably well, in a
quiet and subdued tone, very distinctly, and with marked
emphasis and intonation&mdash;in fact, in a most gentlemanly
manner&mdash;having sedulously studied under a crack theatrical
teacher of elocution, who had given him several
"points"&mdash;in fact, a new reading entirely of one of the
clauses in the Lord's Prayer; and which, he had the gratification
of perceiving, produced a striking, if not, indeed,
a startling effect. On the little finger of the hand which
he used most, was to be observed the sparkle of a diamond
ring; and there was a sort of careless grace in the
curl of his hair, which it had taken his hairdresser at least
half an hour, before Mr. Velvet's leaving home for his
chapel, to secure. In the pulpit he was calm and fluent.
<i>That</i>, he rightly considered, ought not to be the scene for
attempting intellectual display. He took care, therefore,
that there should be nothing in his sermons to arrest the
<i>understanding</i>, or unprofitably occupy it; addressing himself
entirely to the feelings and fancy of his cultivated
audience, in frequently interesting and even charming imaginative
compositions. On the occasion I am speaking
of, he took for his text a fearful passage of Scripture, 2
Cor. iv. 3,&mdash;"<i>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them
that are lost.</i>" If any words were calculated to startle
such a congregation as was arrayed before Mr. Velvet, out
of their guilty and fatal apathy, were not these? Ought
not their minister to have looked round him and trembled?
So one would have thought; but "<i>dear</i> Mr. Velvet"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
knew his mission and his flock better. He presented
them with an elegant description of heaven, with its crystal
battlements, its jasper walls, its buildings of pure gold,
its foundations of precious stones; its balmy air, its
sounds of mysterious melody, its overflowing fulness of
everlasting happiness&mdash;amid which friends, parted upon
earth by the cruel stroke of death, recognize and are reunited
to each other, never more to pronounce the agonizing
word "adieu!" And would his dear hearers be
content to lose all this&mdash;content to <i>enjoy the pleasures of
sin for a season</i>? Forbid it, eternal mercy!&mdash;But lest a
strain like this should disturb or distress his hearers, he
took the opportunity to enforce and illustrate the consolatory
truth that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Religion never was design'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To <i>make our pleasures less</i>;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and presently resuming the thread of his discourse, went
on to speak of the unquestionably serious consequences
attending a persevering indifference to religion; and proceeded
to give striking instances of it in&mdash;the merchant
in his counting-house, and on 'change; the lawyer in his
office; the tradesman in his shop; the operative in the
manufactory; showing how each was absorbed in his calling&mdash;<i>laboring
for the meat which perisheth</i>, till he had lost
all appetite and relish for spiritual food, and never once
troubled himself about "the momentous concerns of hereafter!"
Upon these topics he dwelt with such force and
feeling, that he sent his distinguished congregation away&mdash;those
of them, at least, who could retain any recollection
of what they had heard for five minutes after entering
their carriages&mdash;with lively fears that there was a
very black look-out, indeed, for&mdash;the kind of persons
whom Mr. Velvet had mentioned&mdash;viz. tailors, milliners,
mercers, jewellers, and so forth; and who added graver
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
offences, and of a more positive character, to the misconduct
which he had pointed out&mdash;in their extortion and
their rapacity! Would that some of them had been present!&mdash;Thus
was it that dear Mr. Velvet sent away his
hearers overflowing with Christian sympathy; very well
pleased with Mr. Velvet, but infinitely better pleased with
themselves! The deep impression he had made, was evidenced
by a note which he received that evening from the
Duchess of Broadacre; most earnestly begging permission
to copy his "beautiful sermon," in order to send it to her
sister, Lady Belle Almacks, who (through early dissipation)
was ill of a decline at Naples. I may as well here
mention, that about the time of which I am speaking,
there came out an engraved portrait of "the Rev. Morphine
Velvet, M. A., Minister of Rosemary Chapel, St.
James," and a very charming picture it was, representing
the aforesaid Mr. Velvet in pulpit costume and attitude,
with hands gracefully outstretched, and his face directed
upward, with a heavenly expression; suggesting to you
the possibility that some fine day, when his hearers least
expected it, he might gently rise out of his pulpit into
the air, like Stephen, with heaven open before him, and
<i>be no more seen of men!</i></p>

<p>Four or five carriages had to set down before that containing
the Earl of Dreddlington, Lady Cecilia, and Mr.
Titmouse, could draw up; by which time there had accumulated
as many in its rear, so eager were the pious
aristocrats to get into this <i>holy retreat</i>. As Titmouse,
holding his hat and cane in one hand, while with the
other he arranged his hair, strutted up the centre aisle,
following the earl and Lady Cecilia, he could hardly
repress the exultation with which he thought of a former
visit of his to that very fabric some two years before.
<i>Then</i>, on attempting to enter the body of the chapel, the
vergers had politely but firmly repulsed him; on which,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
swelling with vexation, he had ascended to the gallery,
where, after having been kept standing for ten minutes
at least, he had been beckoned by the pew-opener towards,
and squeezed into, the furthermost pew, close at the back
of the organ, and in which said pew were two powdered
footman. If disgusted with his mere contiguity, guess
what must have been his feelings when his nearest companion
good-naturedly forced upon him a part of his
prayer-book; which Titmouse, ready to spit in his face,
held with his finger and thumb, as though it had been
the tail of a snake! <i>Now</i>, how changed was all! He
had become an aristocrat; in his veins ran some of the
richest and oldest blood in the country; his brow might
ere long be graced by the coronet which King Henry II.
had placed upon the brow of the founder of his family,
some seven hundred years before; and a tall footman,
with powdered head, glistening silver shoulder-knot, and
sky-blue livery, and carrying in a bag the gilded implements
of devotion, was humbly following behind him!
What a remarkable and vivid contrast between his present
and his former circumstances, was present at that
moment to his reflecting mind! As he stood, his hat
covering his face, in an attitude of devotion&mdash;"I wonder,"
thought he, "what all these nobs and swells would
say, if they knew the sort of figure I had cut here on the
last time?" and again&mdash;"'Pon my life, what would I
give for&mdash;say Huckaback&mdash;to see me just now!"
What an elegant and fashionable air the congregation
wore! Surely there <i>must</i> be something in religion, when
people such as were around him came so punctually to
church, and behaved so seriously! The members of that
congregation were, indeed, exemplary in their strict discharge
of their public religious duties! Scarce one of
them was there who had not been at the opera till twelve
o'clock over-night; the dulcet notes of the singers were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
still thrilling in their ears, the graceful attitudes of the
dancers still present to their eyes. Every previous night
of the week had they been engaged in the brilliant ball-room,
and whirled in the mazes of the voluptuous waltz,
or glittering in the picturesque splendor of fancy dress,
till three, four, and five o'clock in the morning: yet here
they were in the house of God, in spite of all their exhaustion,
testified by the heavy eye, the ill-suppressed yawn,
the languor and ennui visible in their countenances, prepared
to accompany their polite pastor, "with a pure heart
and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace,"
to acknowledge, with lively emotion, that they "had
followed too much the devices and desires of their own
hearts;" praying for "mercy upon them, miserable offenders,"
that God would "restore them, being penitent," so
that "they might thereafter lead a godly, righteous, and
sober life." Here they were, punctual to their time, decorous
in manner, devout in spirit, earnest and sincere in
repentance and good resolutions&mdash;knowing, nevertheless
the while, how would be spent the remainder of the
season&mdash;of their <i>lives</i>; and yet resolving to attend to
the respectfully affectionate entreaties of Mr. Velvet, to
be "<i>not hearers only, but doers of the word</i>." Generally,
I should say, that the state of mind of most, if not all of
those present, was analogous to that of persons who sit in
the pump-room, to drink the Bath or Cheltenham waters.
Everybody did the same thing; and each hoped that,
while sitting in his pew, what he heard would, like what
he drank at the pump-room, in some secret mode of
operation, insensibly benefit the hearer, without subjecting
him to any unpleasant restraint or discipline&mdash;without
requiring active exertion, or inconvenience, or sacrifice.
This will give you a pretty accurate notion of Lord Dreddlington's
state of mind upon the present occasion. With
his gold glasses on, he followed with his eye, and also
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
with his voice, every word of the prayers, with rigid accuracy
and unwavering earnestness; but as soon as Mr.
Velvet had mounted the pulpit, and risen to deliver his
discourse, the earl quietly folded his arms, closed his
eyes, and, in an attentive posture, dignifiedly composed
himself to sleep. Lady Cecilia sat beside him perfectly
motionless during the whole sermon, her eyes fixed languidly
upon the preacher. As for Titmouse, he bore it
pretty well for about five minutes; then he pulled his
gloves off and on at least twenty times; then he twisted
his handkerchief round his fingers; then he looked with
a vexed air at his watch; then he stuck his glass in his
eye, and stared about him. By the time that Mr. Velvet
had ceased, Titmouse had conceived a very great dislike
to him, and was indeed in a fretful humor. But
when the organ struck up, and they rose to go; when
he mingled with the soft, crushing, fluttering, rustling,
satin-clad throng&mdash;nodding to one, bowing to another,
and shaking hands with a third, he felt "himself again."
The only difference between him and those around him
was, that <i>they</i> had learned to bear with calm fortitude
what had so severely tried <i>his</i> temper. All were glad to
get out: the crash of carriages at the door was music in
their ears&mdash;the throng of servants delightful objects to
their eyes&mdash;they were, in short, in the dear world again,
and breathed as freely as ever!</p>

<p>Mr. Titmouse took leave of the earl and Lady Cecilia
at their carriage-door, having ordered his cab to be in
waiting&mdash;as it was; and entering it, he drove about leisurely
till it was time to think of dressing for dinner. He
had accepted an invitation to dine with a party of officers
in the Guards, and a merry time they had on't. Titmouse
in due time got blind drunk; and then one of his
companions, rapidly advancing towards the same happy
state, seized the opportunity, with a burned cork, to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
blacken poor Titmouse's face all over&mdash;who thereupon
was pronounced to bear a very close resemblance to one
of the black boys belonging to the band of the regiment;
and thus, when dead drunk, afforded nearly as much fun
to his companions as when sober. As he was quite incapable
of taking care of himself, they put a servant with
him into his cab, (judging his little tiger to be unequal
to the responsibility.)</p>

<p>Titmouse passed a sad night, but got better towards
the middle of the ensuing day; when he was sufficiently
recovered to receive two visitors. One of them was young
Lord Frederic Feather, (accompanied by a friend,) both
of whom had dined in company with Titmouse over-night;
and his Lordship it was, who, having decorated Titmouse's
countenance in the way I have described&mdash;so as to throw
his valet almost into fits on seeing him brought home&mdash;imagining
it might possibly come to his ears who it was
that had done him such a favor, had come to acknowledge
and apologize for it frankly and promptly. When, however,
he perceived what a fool he had got to deal with,
he suddenly changed his course&mdash;declared that Titmouse
had not only done it himself, but had then presumed to
act similarly towards his Lordship, whose friend corroborated
the charge&mdash;and they had called to receive, in private,
<i>an apology</i>! Titmouse's breath seemed taken away
on first hearing this astounding version of the affair. He
swore that he had done nothing of the sort, but had <i>suffered</i>
a good deal; dropping, however, from the tight rope,
on observing the stern looks of his companions, he protested
that at all events "he did not recollect" anything of
the kind; on which they smiled good-naturedly, and said
that <i>that</i> was very possible. Then Titmouse made the
requisite apology; and thus this "awkward affair" ended.
Lord Frederic continued for some time with Titmouse in
pleasant chat; for he foresaw that, "hard up" as he frequently
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
was, Mr. Titmouse was a friend who might be exceedingly
serviceable. In fact, poor Lord Frederic could,
on that very occasion, have almost gone on his knees for
a check of Mr. Titmouse upon his bankers for a couple
of hundred pounds. Oh, thought that "noble" young
spark&mdash;what would <i>he</i> have given to be in Titmouse's
position, with his twenty thousand a-year, and a hundred
thousand pounds of hard cash! But, as the reader well
knows, poor Titmouse's resources, ample as they were,
were upon a far less splendid scale than was supposed.
Partly from inclination, and partly through a temporary
sense of embarrassment, occasioned by the want of ready
money, Titmouse did not spend a tenth part of the sum
which it had been everywhere supposed he could disburse
freely on all hands: and this occasioned him to be given
credit for possessing all that rumor assigned to him; and,
moreover, for a disposition not to squander it. He had
several times been induced to try his hand at écarté,
rouge et noir, and hazard; and had, on the first occasion
or two, been a little hurried away, through deference to
his distinguished associates, and bled rather freely; but
when he found that it was a matter of <i>business</i>&mdash;that
he must <i>pay</i>&mdash;and felt his purse growing lighter, and
his pocket-book, in which he kept his bank-notes, rapidly
shrinking in dimensions as the evening wore on, he experienced
vivid alarm and disgust, and an increasing disinclination
to be "victimized;" and his aversion to play
was infinitely strengthened by the frequent cautions of
his distinguished and disinterested monitor, the Earl of
Dreddlington.</p>

<p>But there was one step in Mr. Titmouse's upward progress
which he presently took, and which is worthy of
special mention; I mean his presentation at court by the
Earl of Dreddlington. The necessity for such a move was
explained to Titmouse by his illustrious kinsman, a day
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
or two after the appearance of the ordinary official announcement
of the next levee. This momentous affair
was broached by the earl, one day after dinner, with an
air of almost mysterious anxiety and interest. Had, indeed,
that stately and solemn old simpleton been instructing
his gaping protégé, in the minutely-awful etiquettes
requisite for the due discharge of his duties, as an ambassador
sent upon a delicate and embarrassing mission to
the court of his Sacred Majesty the King of Sulkypunctilio,
he could not have appeared more penetrated by a
sense of the responsibility he was incurring. He commenced
by giving Titmouse a very long history of the
origin and progress of such ceremonies, and a minute account
of the practical manner of their observance, all of
which, however, was to Titmouse only like breathing upon
a mirror&mdash;passing as quickly out of one ear as it had entered
into the other. When, however, the earl came to
the point of dress, Titmouse was indeed "a thing all ear,
all eye," his little faculties being stimulated to their utmost.
The next morning he hurried off to his tailor, to
order a court dress. When it had been brought home for
trial, and he had put it on, upon returning to his room in
his new and imposing costume, and glancing at his figure
in the glass, his face fell; and he felt infinitely disappointed.
It is to be remembered in candor, however,
that he had not on lace ruffles at his coat-cuffs, nor on
his shirt-front. After gazing at himself for a few moments
in silence, he suddenly snapped his fingers, and
exclaimed to the tailor, who, with the valet, was standing
beside him, "Curse me if I like this thing at all!"</p>

<p>"Not like it, sir!" exclaimed Mr. Clipclose, with
astonishment.</p>

<p>"No, I don't, demme! Is <i>this</i> a court dress? It's a
quaker's made into a footman's! 'Pon my soul, I look
the exact image of a footman; and a devilish vulgar one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
too!" The two individuals beside him turned suddenly
away&mdash;looking in different directions&mdash;and from their
noses there issued the sounds of ill-suppressed laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir&mdash;I beg a thousand pardons!"&mdash;quickly exclaimed
Mr. Clipclose, "what can I have been thinking
about? There's the sword&mdash;we've quite forgot it!"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;'pon my life, I thought there was <i>something</i>
wrong!" quoth Titmouse, as Mr. Clipclose, having brought
the sword from the table at the other end of the room,
where he had laid it upon entering, buckled it upon his
distinguished customer.</p>

<p>"I flatter myself that <i>now</i>, sir"&mdash;commenced he.</p>

<p>"Ya&mdash;as&mdash;Quite the correct thing! 'Pon my soul&mdash;must
say&mdash;most uncommon striking!"&mdash;exclaimed
Titmouse, glancing at his figure in the glass, with a triumphant
smile. "Isn't it odd, now, that this sword
should make all the difference between me and a footman,
by Jove?" Here his two companions were seized
with a simultaneous fit of coughing.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha&mdash;it's <i>so</i>, a'n't it?" continued Titmouse, his
eyes glued to the glass.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," replied Mr. Clipclose, "it undoubtedly
gives&mdash;what shall I call it? a grace&mdash;a finish&mdash;a sort
of commanding appearance&mdash;especially to a figure that
becomes it"&mdash;he continued with cool assurance, observing
that the valet understood him. "But&mdash;may I,
sir, take so great a liberty? If you are not accustomed
to wear a sword&mdash;as I think you said you had not been
at court before&mdash;I beg to remind you that it will require
particular care to manage it, and prevent it from getting
between"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Demme, sir!" exclaimed Titmouse, turning round
with an offended air&mdash;"d'ye think I don't know how
to manage a sword? By all that's tremendous"&mdash;and
plucking the taper weapon out of its scabbard, he waved
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
it over his head; and throwing himself into the first position&mdash;he
had latterly paid a good deal of attention to
fencing&mdash;with rather an excited air, he went through
several of the preliminary movements. 'Twas a subject
for a painter, and exhibited a very striking spectacle&mdash;as
an instance of power silently concentrated, and ready
to be put forth upon an adequate occasion. The tailor
and the valet, who stood separate from each other, and at
a safe and respectful distance from Mr. Titmouse, gazed
at him with silent admiration.</p>

<p>When the great day arrived&mdash;Titmouse having thought
of scarce anything else in the interval, and teased every
one whom he had met with his endless questions and
childish observations on the subject&mdash;he drove up, at
the appointed hour, to the Earl of Dreddlington's; whose
carriage, with an appearance of greater state than usual
about it, was standing at the door. On alighting from his
cab, he skipped so nimbly up-stairs, that he could not have
had time to observe the amusement which his figure occasioned
even to the well-disciplined servants of the Earl
of Dreddlington. Much allowance ought to have been
made for them. Think of Mr. Titmouse's little knee-breeches,
white silks, silver shoe-buckles, shirt ruffles and
frills, coat, bag, and sword; and his hair, plastered up
with bear's grease, parted down the middle of his head,
and curling out boldly over each temple; and his open
countenance irradiated with a subdued smile of triumph
and excitement! On entering the drawing-room he beheld
a really striking object&mdash;the earl in court costume,
wearing his general's uniform, with all his glistening orders,
standing in readiness to set off, and holding in his
hand his hat, with its snowy plume. His posture was at
once easy and commanding. Had he been standing to Sir
Thomas Lawrence, he could not have disposed himself more
effectively. Lady Cecilia was sitting on the sofa, leaning
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
back, and languidly talking to him; and, from the start
which they both gave on Titmouse's entrance, it was plain
that they could not have calculated upon the extraordinary
transmogrification he must have undergone, in assuming
court costume. For a moment or two, each was as severely
shocked as when his absurd figure had first presented itself
in that drawing-room. "Oh, heavens!" murmured Lady
Cecilia: while the earl seemed struck dumb by the approaching
figure of Titmouse. That gentleman, however,
was totally changed from the Titmouse of a former day.
He had now acquired a due sense of his personal importance,
a just confidence in himself. Greatness had lost its former
petrifying influence over him. And, as for his appearance
on the present occasion, <i>he</i> had grown so familiar with it,
as reflected in his glass, that it never occurred to him that
the case might be different with others who beheld him
for the first time. The candor upon which I pride myself
urges me to state, however, that when Titmouse beheld
the military air and superb equipments of the earl&mdash;notwithstanding
that Titmouse, too, wore a sword&mdash;he felt
himself <i>done</i>. He advanced, nevertheless, pretty confidently&mdash;bobbing
about, first to Lady Cecilia, and then
to the earl; and after a hasty salutation, observed,&mdash;"'Pon
my life, my Lord, I hope it's no offence, but
your Lordship <i>does</i> look most remarkable fine." The earl
made no reply, but inclined towards him magnificently&mdash;not
seeing the meaning and intention of Titmouse, but
being affronted by his words.</p>

<p>"May I ask what your Lordship thinks of <i>me</i>? First
time I ever appeared in this kind of thing, my Lord&mdash;ha!
ha, your Lordship sees!" As he spoke, his look and
voice betrayed the overawing effects of the earl's splendid
appearance, which was rapidly freezing up the springs
of familiarity, if not, indeed, of flippancy, which were
bubbling up within the little bosom of Titmouse, on his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
entering the room. His manner became involuntarily
subdued and reverential. The Earl of Dreddlington in
plain clothes, and in full court costume, were two very
different persons; though his Lordship would have been
terribly mortified if he had known that any one thought
so. However much he now regretted having offered to
take Titmouse to the levee, there was no escape from the
calamity; so, after a few minutes' pause, his Lordship rang
the bell, and announced his readiness to set off. Followed
by Mr. Titmouse, the earl slowly descended the stairs; and
when he was within two or three steps of the hall floor,
it distresses me to relate, that his Lordship suddenly fell
nearly flat upon his face, and, but for his servants' rushing
up, would have been seriously hurt. Poor Titmouse
had been the occasion of this dismal disaster; for his sword
getting between his legs, down he went against the earl,
who went naturally down upon the floor, as I have mentioned.
Titmouse was not much hurt, but terribly frightened,
and became as pale as death when he looked at the
earl; who appeared a little agitated, but, not having been
really injured, soon recovered a considerable measure of
self-possession. Profuse were poor Titmouse's apologies,
as may be supposed; but much as he was distressed at
what had taken place, a glance at the angry countenances
with which the servants regarded him, as if inwardly cursing
his stupidity and clumsiness, stirred up his spirit a
little with a feeling of resentment. He would have given
a hundred pounds to have been able to discharge every
one of them on the spot!&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;enough has been said," quoth the earl, rather
coldly and haughtily, tired of the multiplied apologies
and excuses of Titmouse. "I thank God, sir, that I am
not hurt, though at my time of life a fall is not a slight
matter. Sir," continued the earl, bitterly&mdash;again interrupting
Titmouse&mdash;"<i>you</i> are not so much to blame as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
your tailor; he should have explained to you how to
wear your sword!" With this, having cut Titmouse to
the very quick, the earl motioned him towards the door.
They soon entered the carriage; the door was closed;
and, with a brace of footmen behind, away rolled these
two truly distinguished subjects to pay their homage to
Majesty&mdash;which might well be proud of such homage!&mdash;They
both sat in silence for some time. At length&mdash;"Beg
your Lordship's pardon," quoth Titmouse, with
some energy; "but I wish your Lordship only knew how
I <i>hate</i> this cursed skewer that's pinned to me:" and he
looked at his sword, as if he could have snapped it into
halves, and thrown them through the window.</p>

<p>"Sir, I can appreciate your feelings. The sword was
not to blame; and <i>you</i> have my forgiveness," replied the
still ruffled earl.</p>

<p>"Much obliged to your Lordship," replied Titmouse,
in a somewhat different tone from any in which he had
ever ventured to address his august companion; for he
was beginning to feel confoundedly nettled at the bitter
contemptuous manner which the earl observed towards
him. He was also not a little enraged with himself; for
he knew he had been in fault, and thought of the neglected
advice of his tailor. So his natural insolence, like
a reptile just beginning to recover from its long torpor,
made a faint struggle to show itself&mdash;but in vain; he
was quite cowed and overpowered by the Presence in
which he was, and he wished heartily that he could have
recalled even the few last words he had ventured to utter.
The earl had observed his presumptuous flippancy of
manner, though without appearing to do so. His Lordship
was accustomed to control his feelings; and on the
present occasion made some effort to do so, for fear of
alienating Titmouse from him by any display of offended
dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir, it is a very fine day," he observed in a kind manner,
after a stern silence of at least five minutes.</p>

<p>"Remarkable fine, my Lord. I was just going to say
so," replied Titmouse, greatly relieved; and presently
they fell into their usual strain of conversation.</p>

<p>"We must learn to bear these little annoyances calmly,"
said the earl, graciously, on Titmouse's again alluding
to his mishap;&mdash;"as for me, sir, a person in the station
to which it has pleased Heaven to call me, for purposes
of its own, has his peculiar and very grave anxieties&mdash;substantial
anx"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He ceased suddenly. The carriage of his old rival, the
Earl of Fitz-Walter, passed him; the latter waved his
hand courteously; the former, with a bitter smile, was
forced to do the same; and then relapsing into silence,
showed that <i>the iron was entering his soul</i>. Thus the
earl in his own person afforded a striking illustration of
the truth of the observation which he had been making
to Titmouse. Soon, however, they had entered the scene
of splendid hubbub, which at once occupied and excited
both their little minds. Without, was the eager crowd,
gazing with admiration and awe at each equipage, with
its brilliant occupants, that dashed past them:&mdash;then
the life-guardsmen, in glittering and formidable array,
their long gleaming swords and polished helmets glancing
and flashing in the sunlight. Within, were the tall
yeomen of the guard, in black velvet caps and scarlet
uniforms, and with ponderous partisans, lining each side
of the staircase&mdash;and who, being in the exact military
costume of the time of Henry the Eighth, forcibly recalled
those days of pomp and pageantry to the well-informed
mind of Mr. Titmouse. In short, for the first time in
his life, he beheld, and was overwhelmed by, the grandeur,
state, and ceremony which fence in the dread approaches
to <small>MAJESTY</small>. He was, fortunately, far too much
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
bewildered and flustered, to be aware of the ill-concealed
tittering and even laughter which his appearance excited,
wherever he went. In due course he was borne on, and
issued in due form into the presence chamber&mdash;into the
immediate presence of Majesty. His heart palpitated;
his dazzled eye caught a hasty glimpse of a tall magnificent
figure and a throne. Advancing&mdash;scarce aware
whether on his head or his heels&mdash;he reverently paid
his homage&mdash;then rising, was promptly ushered out
through a different door; with no distinct impression of
anything that he had witnessed!&mdash;'twas all a dazzling
blaze of glory&mdash;a dim vision of awe! Little was he
aware, poor soul, that the king had required him to be
pointed out upon his approach, having heard of his celebrity
in society; and that he had had the distinguished
honor of occasioning to Majesty a very great effort to
keep its countenance. It was not till after he had quitted
the palace for some time, that he breathed freely again.
Then he began to feel as if a vast change had been effected
in him by some mysterious and awful agency&mdash;that
he was penetrated and pervaded, as it were, by the
subtle essence of royalty&mdash;like one having experienced
the sudden, strange, thrilling, potent influence of electricity.
He imagined that now the stamp of greatness
had been impressed upon him; that his pretensions had
been ratified by the highest authority upon earth. 'Twas
as if wine had been poured into a stream, intoxicating
the <i>tittlebats</i> swimming about in it!&mdash;As for me, however,
seriously speaking, I question whether anything more
than an <i>imaginary</i> change had come over my friend.
Though I should be sorry to quote against him language
with which I have reason to believe he was not <i>critically</i>
acquainted, I cannot help expressing an opinion that
Horace must have had in his eye a <span class="smcap">Roman Titmouse</span>,
when he penned those bitter lines
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>While Titmouse was making this splendid figure in the
upper regions of society, and forming there every hour
new and brilliant connections and associations&mdash;in a
perfect whirl of pleasure from morning to night&mdash;he
did not ungratefully manifest a total forgetfulness of the
amiable persons with whom he had been so familiar, and
from whom he had received so many good offices, in his
earlier days and humbler circumstances. Had it not,
however&mdash;to give the devil his due&mdash;been for Gammon,
(who was ever beside him, like a mysterious pilot, secretly
steering his little bark amid the strange, splendid, but
dangerous seas which it had now to navigate,) I fear that,
with Titmouse, it would have been&mdash;out of sight out of
mind. But Gammon, ever watchful over the real interests
of his charge, and also delighted, through the native
goodness of his heart, to become the medium of conferring
favors upon others, conveyed from time to time, to
the interesting family of the Tag-rags, special marks of
Mr. Titmouse's courtesy and gratitude. At one time, a
haunch of <i>doe</i> venison would find its way to Mr. Tag-rag,
to whom Gammon justly considered that the distinction
between buck and doe was unknown; at another, a fine
work-box and a beautifully bound Bible found its way to
good Mrs. Tag-rag; and lastly, a gay guitar to Miss Tag-rag,
who forthwith began twang-twang, tang-a-tang-tanging
it, from morning to night, thinking with ecstasy of its
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
dear distinguished donor; who, together with Mr. Gammon,
had, some time afterwards, the unspeakable gratification,
on the occasion of their being invited to dine at
Satin Lodge, of hearing her accompany herself with her
beautiful instrument while singing the following exquisite
composition, for both the words and air of which she had
been indebted to her music-master, a youth with black
mustaches, long dark hair parted on his head, shirt-collars
à-la-Byron, and eyes full of inspiration!</p>

<p>Such were the tender and melting strains which this
fair creature (her voice a <i>little</i> reedy and squeaking, it
must be owned) poured into the sensitive ear of Titmouse;
and such are the strains by means of which,
many and many a Miss Tag-rag has captivated many and
many a Titmouse; so that sentimental compositions of
this sort have become deservedly popular, and do honor
to our musical and poetical character as a nation. I said
that it was on the occasion of a dinner at Satin Lodge,
that Mr. Titmouse and Mr. Gammon were favored by
hearing Miss Tag-rag's voice, accompanying her guitar;
for when Mr. Tag-rag had sounded Mr. Gammon, and
found that both he and Titmouse would be only too
proud and happy to partake of his hospitality, they were
invited. A very crack affair it was, (though I have not
time to describe it)&mdash;given on a far more splendid scale
than Mr. Tag-rag had ever ventured upon before. He
brought a bottle of <i>champagne</i> all the way from town
with his own hands, and kept it nice and cool in the
kitchen cistern for three days beforehand; and there
was fish, soup, roast mutton, and roast ducks, roast fowls,
peas, cabbage, cauliflowers, potatoes, vegetable marrows;
there was an apple-pie, a plum-pudding, custards, creams,
jelly, and a man to wait, hired from the tavern at the
corner of the hill. It had not occurred to them to provide
themselves with champagne glasses, so they managed
as well as they could with the common ones&mdash;all but
Titmouse, who with a sort of fashionable recklessness, to
show how little he thought of champagne, poured it out
into his <i>tumbler</i>, which he two-thirds filled, and then drank
off its contents at a draught! Mr. Tag-rag trying to disguise
the inward spasm it occasioned him, by a very
grievous smile. He and Mrs. Tag-rag exchanged anxious
looks; the whole of their sole bottle of champagne was
gone already&mdash;almost as soon as it had been opened!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>"I always drink this sort of stuff out of a tumbler;
I do&mdash;'pon my life," said Titmouse, carelessly; "it's a
devilish deal more pleasant than sipping it out of wine
glasses!"</p>

<p>"Ye-e-s&mdash;of course it is, sir," said Mr. Tag-rag, rather
faintly. Shortly afterwards, Titmouse offered to take a
glass of champagne with Miss Tag-rag!&mdash;Her father's
face flushed; and at length, with a bold effort, "Why,
Mr. Titmouse," said he, trying desperately to look unconcerned&mdash;"the&mdash;the
fact is, I never keep more than
a dozen or so in my cellar&mdash;and most unfortunately
I found this afternoon that six bottles had&mdash;burst&mdash;I
assure you."</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, sorry to hear it," quoth Titmouse, in a
patronizing way; "must send you a dozen of my own&mdash;I
always keep about fifty or a hundred dozen. Oh, I'll
send you half a dozen!"</p>

<p>Tag-rag scarcely knew, for a moment, whether he felt
pleased or mortified at this stroke of delicate generosity.
Thus it was that Titmouse evinced a disposition to shower
marks of his favor and attachment upon the Tag-rags, in
obedience to the injunctions of Gammon, who assured him
that it continued to be of very great importance for him
to secure the good graces of Mr. Tag-rag. So Mr. Titmouse
now drove up to Satin Lodge in his cab, and then
rode thither, followed by his stylish groom; and on one
occasion, artful little scamp! happening to find no one
at home but Miss Tag-rag, he nevertheless alighted, and
stayed for nearly ten minutes, behaving precisely in the
manner of an accepted suitor, aware that he might do so
with impunity since there was no witness present; a little
matter which had been suggested to him by Mr. Gammon.
Poor Miss Tag-rag's cheek he kissed with every
appearance of ardor, protesting that she was a monstrous
lovely creature; and he left her in a state of delighted
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
excitement, imagining herself the destined mistress of ten
thousand a-year&mdash;the blooming bride of the gay and
fashionable Mr. Titmouse. When her excellent parents
heard of what had that day occurred between Mr. Titmouse
and their daughter, they also looked upon the
thing as quite settled, and were eager in their expressions
of gratitude to Providence. In the mean while, the
stream of prosperity flowed steadily in upon Mr. Tag-rag,
his shop continuing crowded; his shopmen doubled in
number:&mdash;in fact, he at length actually received, instead
of giving payment, for allowing young men to serve a
short time in so celebrated an establishment, in order
that they might learn the first-rate style of doing business,
and when established on their own account, write
up over their doors&mdash;"Timothy Tape, <i>late from Tag-rag
&amp; Co., Oxford Street</i>."</p>

<p>Determined to make hay while the sun shone, he resorted
to several little devices for that purpose, such as
a shirt-front with frills in the shape of a capital "T," and
of which, under the name of "<i>Titties</i>," he sold immense
numbers among the Eastern <i>swells</i> of London. At length
it occurred to Gammon to suggest to Titmouse a mode
of conferring upon his old friend and master a mark of
permanent, public, and substantial distinction; and this
was, the obtaining for him, through the Earl of Dreddlington,
an appointment as one of the <i>royal tradesmen</i>&mdash;namely,
draper and hosier to the king. When Mr. Tag-rag's
disinterested and indefatigable benefactor, Gammon,
called one day in Oxford Street, and, motioning him for
a moment out of the bustle of his crowded shop, mentioned
the honor which Mr. Titmouse was bent upon
doing his utmost, at Mr. Gammon's instance, to procure
for Mr. Tag-rag, that respectable person was quite at a
loss for terms in which adequately to express his gratitude.
Titmouse readily consented to name the thing to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
the great man, and urge it in the best way he could;
and he performed his promise. The earl listened to his
application with an air of anxiety. "Sir," said he, "the
world is acquainted with my reluctance to ask favors of
those in office. When I was in office myself, I felt the
inconvenience of such applications abundantly. Besides,
the appointment you have named, happens to be one of
considerable importance, and requiring great influence to
procure it. Consider, sir, the immense number of tradesmen
there are of every description, of whom drapers and
hosiers (according to the last returns laid before Parliament
at the instance of my friend Lord Goose) are by far
the most numerous. All of them are naturally ambitious
of so high a distinction: yet, sir, observe, that there is
only one king and one royal family to serve. My Lord
Chamberlain is, I have no doubt, harassed by applicants
for such honors as you have mentioned."</p>

<p>Hereat Titmouse got startled at the unexpected magnitude
of the favor he had applied for; and, declaring
that he did not care a curse for Tag-rag, begged to withdraw
his application. But the earl, with a mighty fine
air, interrupted him&mdash;"Sir, you are not in the least presuming
upon your relationship with me, nor do I think
you overrate the influence I may happen&mdash;in short, sir,
I will make it my business to see my Lord <span class="smcap">Ko-too</span> this
very day, and sound him upon the subject."</p>

<p>That same afternoon an interview took place between
the two distinguished noblemen, Lord Dreddlington and
Lord Ko-too. Each approached the other upon stilts. After
a display of the most delicate tact on the part of Lord
Dreddlington, Lord Ko-too, who made a mighty piece of
work of it, promised to consider the application.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>Within a day or two afterwards, Mr. Tag-rag received a
letter from the Lord Chamberlain's office, notifying him
that his Majesty had been graciously pleased to appoint
him draper and hosier to his Majesty! It occasioned him
feelings of tumultuous pride and pleasure, similar to those
with which the Earl of Dreddlington would have received
tidings of his long-coveted marquisate having been conferred
upon him. He started off, within a quarter of an
hour after the receipt of the letter, to a carver and gilder
a few doors off, and gave orders for the immediate preparation
of a first-rate cast, gilded, of the royal arms;
which, in about a week's time, might be seen, a truly resplendent
object, dazzlingly conspicuous over the central
door of Mr. Tag-rag's establishment, inspiring awe into the
minds of passers-by, and envy into Mr. Tag-rag's neighbors
and rivals. He immediately sent off letters of gratitude
to Mr. Titmouse, and to "the Right Honorable, the
Most Noble the Earl of Dreddlington;" to the latter
personage, at the same time, forwarding a most splendid
crimson satin flowered dressing-gown, as "an humble token
of his gratitude for his Lordship's mark of particular
condescension."</p>

<p>Both the letter and the dressing-gown gave great satisfaction
to the earl's valet, (than whom they never got any
farther,) and who, having tried on the glistening addition
to his wardrobe, forthwith sat down and wrote a very fine
reply, in his Lordship's name, to the note which had accompanied
it, taking an opportunity to satisfy his conscience,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
by stating to the earl the next morning that a
Mr. Tag-rag had "<i>called</i>" to express his humble thanks
for his Lordship's goodness. He was, moreover, so well
satisfied with this specimen of Mr. Tag-rag's articles, that
he forthwith opened an account with him, and sent a very
liberal order to start with. The same thing occurred with
several of the subordinate functionaries at the palace;
and&mdash;to let my reader, a little prematurely, however,
into a secret&mdash;this was the extent of the additional custom
which Mr. Tag-rag's appointment secured him; and,
even for these supplies, I never heard of his getting paid.
But it did wonders with him in the estimation of the
world. 'Twas evident that he was in a fair way of becoming
the head house in the trade. His appointment
caused no little ferment in that nook of the city with
which he was connected. The worshipful Company of
Squirt-Makers elected him a member; and on a vacancy
suddenly occurring in the ward to which he belonged, for
he had a considerable shop in the city also, he was made
a common council-man. Mr. Tag-rag soon made a great
stir as a champion of civil and religious liberty. As for
church and county rates, in particular, he demonstrated
the gross injustice and absurdity of calling upon one who
had no <i>personal</i> occasion for the use of a church, of a
county bridge, a county jail, or a lunatic asylum, to be
called upon to contribute to the support of them. A few
speeches in this strain attracted so much attention to him,
that several leading men in the ward (a very "liberal"
one) intimated to him that he stood the best chance of
succeeding to the honor of alderman on the next vacancy;
and when he and Mrs. Tag-rag were alone together, he
would start the subject of the expenses of the mayoralty
with no little anxiety. He went to the chapel no longer
on foot, but in a stylish sort of covered gig, with a kind of
coal-scuttle shaped box screwed on behind, into which was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
squeezed his footboy, (who, by the way, had a thin stripe
of crimson let into each leg of his trousers, upon Mr. Tag-rag's
appointment to an office under the Crown;) he was,
also, always a trifle later in arriving at the chapel, than
he had been accustomed to be. He had a crimson velvet
cushion running along the front of his pew, and the Bibles
and hymn-books very smartly gilded. He was presently
advanced to the honored post of chief deacon; and
on one occasion, in the unexpected absence of the central
luminary of the system, was asked to occupy the chair at
a "great meeting" of the <span class="smcap">Society for the Promotion of
Civil and Religious Discord</span>; when he took the opportunity
of declaring his opinion, which was enthusiastically
cheered, that the principles of free trade ought to be applied
to religion; and that the voluntary system was that
which was designed by God to secure the free blessings of
competition in spiritual teaching. As for Satin Lodge, he
stuck two little wings to it; and had one of the portraits
of Tittlebat Titmouse (as Tippetiwink) hung over his
drawing-room mantel-piece, splendidly framed and glazed.</p>

<p>Some little time after Tag-rag had obtained the royal
appointment, which I have been so particular in recording,
Gammon, <i>happening</i> to be passing his shop, stepped
in, and observing Mr. Tag-rag, very cordially greeted him;
and then, as if it had been a thought of the moment only,
without taking him from the shop, intimated that he had
been westward, engaged in completing the formal details
of a rearrangement of the greater portion of Mr. Titmouse's
extensive estates, upon which that gentleman had
recently determined, and the sight of Mr. Tag-rag's establishment
had suggested to Mr. Gammon, that possibly
Mr. Tag-rag would feel gratified at being made a party&mdash;for
form's sake&mdash;to the transaction; as Mr. Gammon
was sure that Mr. Titmouse would feel delighted at having
associated with the Earl of Dreddlington, and one or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
two other persons of distinction, in the meditated arrangement,
the name of so early and sincere a friend as Mr.
Tag-rag; "one who, moreover"&mdash;here Gammon paused,
and gave a smile of inexpressible significance, "but it was
not for <i>him</i> to hint his suspicions"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;<i>will</i> you come into my room?" interrupted
Tag-rag, rather eagerly, anxious to have a more
definite indication of Mr. Gammon's opinion; but that
gentleman, looking at his watch, pleaded want of time,
and suddenly shaking Mr. Tag-rag by the hand, moved
towards the door.</p>

<p>"You were talking of signing, sir&mdash;Have you got with
you what you want signed? I'll sign anything!&mdash;anything
for Mr. Titmouse; only too proud&mdash;it's quite an
honor to be in any way connected with him!" Gammon,
on hearing this, felt in his pockets, as if he supposed that
he should find there what he perfectly well knew had
been lying ready, cut and dried, in his safe at Saffron
Hill for months.</p>

<p>"I find I have not got the little document with me,"
said he, carelessly; "I suppose it's lying about, with
other loose papers, at the office, or I may have left it at
the earl's"&mdash;[though Gammon's objects required him here
to allude to the Earl of Dreddlington, I think it only fair
to say that he had never been, for one instant in his life,
in that great man's company.]</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Mr. Gammon." said Tag-rag, considering&mdash;"Your
office is at Saffron Hill? Well, I shall
be passing in your direction to-morrow, on my way to my
city establishment, about noon, and will look in and do
all you wish."</p>

<p>"Could you arrange to meet the earl there?&mdash;or, as his
Lordship's movements are&mdash;ah, ha!&mdash;not very"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Should be most proud to meet his Lordship, sir, to
express my personal gratitude"&mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, the earl never likes to be reminded, Mr. Tag-rag,
of any little courtesy or kindness he may have conferred!
But if you will be with us about twelve, we can wait a
little while; and if his Lordship should not be punctual,
we must even let you sign first, ah, ha!&mdash;and explain
it to his Lordship on his arrival, for I know your time
is very precious, Mr. Tag-rag! Gracious! Mr. Tag-rag,
what a constant stream of customers you have!&mdash;I heard
it said, the other day, that you were rapidly absorbing all
the leading business in your line in Oxford Street."</p>

<p>"You're very polite, Mr. Gammon! Certainly, I've
no reason to complain. I always keep the best of everything,
both here and in the city, and sell at the lowest
prices, and spare no pains to please; and it's hard
if"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, how do you do?" quoth Gammon, suddenly starting,
and bowing to some one on the other side of the way,
whom he did <i>not</i> see. "Well, good-day, Mr. Tag-rag&mdash;good-day!
To-morrow at twelve, by the way?"</p>

<p>"I'm yours to command, Mr. Gammon," replied Tag-rag;
and so they parted. Just about twelve o'clock the
next day, the latter, in a great bustle, saying he had fifty
places to call at in the city, made his appearance at Saffron
Hill.</p>

<p>"His Lordship a'n't here, I suppose?" quoth he, after
shaking hands with Mr. Quirk and Mr. Gammon. The
latter gentleman pulled out his watch, and, shrugging his
shoulders, said with a smile, "No&mdash;we'll give him half
an hour's grace."</p>

<p>"Half an hour, my dear sir!" exclaimed Tag-rag, "I
couldn't stay so long, even for the high honor of meeting
his Lordship. I am a man of business, he isn't; first
come first served, you know, eh? All fair that!" There
were a good many recently engrossed parchments and writings
scattered over the table, and from among them Gammon,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
after tossing them about for some time, at length
drew out a sheet of foolscap. It was stamped, and there
was writing upon the first and second pages.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, quick's the word&mdash;time's precious!"
said Tag-rag, taking up a pen and dipping it
into the inkstand. Gammon, with an unconcerned air,
placed before him the document he had been looking for.
"Ah, how well I know the handwriting! That flourish
of his&mdash;a sort of boldness about it, a'n't there?" said
Tag-rag, observing the signature of Titmouse immediately
above the spot on which he was going to place his
own; there being written in pencil, underneath, the word
"Dreddlington," evidently for the intended signature of
the earl. "I'm between two good ones, at any rate,
eh?" said Tag-rag. Gammon or Quirk said something
about a "term to attend the inheritance"&mdash;"trustee of
an outstanding term"&mdash;"legal estate vested in the trustees"&mdash;"too
great power to be put in the hands of any
but those of the highest honor."</p>

<p>"Stay!" quoth Gammon, ringing his little hand-bell&mdash;"nothing
like regularity, even in trifles." He was
answered by one of the clerks, a very dashing person&mdash;"We
only wish you to witness a signature," said Gammon.
"Now, we shall release you, Mr. Tag-rag, in a
moment. Say 'I deliver this as my act and deed'&mdash;putting
your finger on the little wafer there."</p>

<p>So said and so did Mr. Tag-rag as he had been directed;
the clerk wrote his name under the witnessing
clause, "Abominable Amminadab;" and from that moment
Mr. Tag-rag had unconsciously acquired an interest
in the future stability of Mr. Titmouse's fortunes, to the
extent of some <small>FORTY THOUSAND POUNDS</small>.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>, gentlemen, you'll make my compliments to his
Lordship, and if he asks how I came to sign before him,
explain the hurry I was in. Time and tide wait for no
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
man. Good-morning, gentlemen; good-morning; best regards
to our friend, Mr. Titmouse." Gammon attended
him to the door, cordially shaking him by the hand, and
presently returned to the room he had just quitted, where
he found Mr. Quirk holding in his hand the document just
signed by Tag-rag; which was, in fact, a joint and several
bond, conditioned in a penalty of forty thousand pounds,
for the due repayment, by Titmouse, of twenty thousand
pounds, and interest at five per cent, about to be advanced
to him on mortgage of a portion of the Yatton property.
Gammon, sitting down, gently took the instrument from
Mr. Quirk, and with a bit of India-rubber calmly effaced
the pencilled signature of "<i>Dreddlington</i>."</p>

<p>"You're a ve&mdash;ry clever fellow, Gammon!" exclaimed
Mr. Quirk, presently, with a sort of sigh, and after, as it
were, holding his breath for some time. Gammon made
no reply. His face was slightly pale, and wore an anxious
expression. "It will do <i>now</i>," continued Mr. Quirk,
rubbing his hands, and with a gleeful expression of
countenance.</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," replied Gammon, in a low
tone.</p>

<p>"Eh? What? Does anything occur&mdash;eh? By Jove,
no screw loose, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but we're in <i>very deep water</i> now, Mr.
Quirk"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;devil only cares, so long as <i>you</i> keep a sharp
look-out, Gammon. I'll trust the helm to you! I'll pit
you against Old Nick any day, friend Gammon!"</p>

<p>As Gammon did not seem in a talkative mood, Quirk
shortly afterwards left him.</p>

<p>Now, though Mr. Tag-rag is no favorite of mine, I begin
to feel a good deal of anxiety on his behalf. I wish
he had not been in so vast a "hurry," in a matter which
required such grave deliberation, as "signing, sealing,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
and delivering." When a man is called on to go through
so serious a ceremony, it would be well if he could be
apprised of the significance of the formula&mdash;<i>"I deliver
this as my act and deed."</i> Thus hath expressed himself
upon this point, a great authority in the law, old Master
Plowden. 'T is a passage somewhat quaint in form, but
not the less forcible and important in substance:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Words are oft <i>spoken</i> unadvisedly, and pass from men lightly
and inconsiderately; but, where the agreement is by <i>deed</i>,
there is more time for deliberation; for when a man passes a
thing by deed, first, there is the determination of the mind to
do it, and upon that he causes it to be <i>written</i>, which is one
part of deliberation; and, afterwards, he <i>puts his seal to it</i>,
which is another part of deliberation; and, lastly, he <i>delivers
the writing as his deed</i>, which is the consummation of his resolution.
So that there is great deliberation used in the making of
deeds, for which reason they are received as a <i>lien</i>, final to the
party, and are adjudged to bind the party, without examining
upon what cause or consideration they were made."<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Possibly some one now reading these pages hath had
most dismal experience in the matter above mentioned;
and I hope that such dismal experience, a due reflection
will avert from many a reader. As for Tag-rag, it may
turn out that our fears for him are groundless: nevertheless
<i>one hates to see men do important things in a hurry</i>:&mdash;and,
as we shall lose sight of Mr. Tag-rag for some time,
there can be no harm in wishing him well out of what he
has just done.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If it were <i>done</i> when 't is done, then 't were well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It were done <i>quickly</i>"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and not otherwise.</p>

<p>The London season was now advancing towards its close.
Fine ladies were sated and exhausted with operas, concerts,
balls, routs, soirées, assemblies, bazaars, fêtes, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
the Park. Their lords were getting tired of their clubs
during the day, and hurried dinners, late hours, foul air,
and long speeches, at the two Houses; where, however
they might doze away the time, they could seldom get
the luxury of a downright nap for more than an hour or
two together&mdash;always waking, and fancying themselves
in the tower of Babel, and that it was on fire, so strange
and startling were the lights and the hubbub! The very
whippers-in were looking jaded and done&mdash;each being
like a Smithfield drover's dog on a Monday night, which
at length can neither bark nor bite in return for a kick or
a blow, and, hoarse and wearied, falls asleep on his way
home&mdash;a regular somnambulist. Where the Earl of
Dreddlington and Lady Cecilia were to pass their autumn,
was a question which they were beginning to discuss
rather anxiously. Any one glancing over their
flourishing list of residences in England, Scotland, Wales,
and Ireland, which were paraded in the Peerages and
Court Guides, would have supposed that they had an
ample choice before them: but the reader of this history
knows better. The mortifying explanation&mdash;mortifying
to the poor earl&mdash;having been once given by me, I shall
not again do so. Suffice it to say, that Poppleton Hall,
Hertfordshire, had its disadvantages; there they must keep
up a full establishment, and receive county company
and other visitors&mdash;being in arrear with much hospitality.
'Twas expensive work, also, at the watering-places;
and expensive and also troublesome to go abroad
at the earl's advanced period of life. Pensively ruminating
on these matters one evening, they were interrupted
by a servant bringing in a note, which proved to be from
Titmouse&mdash;inviting them, in terms of profound courtesy
and great cordiality, to honor Yatton, by making a stay
there during as great a portion of the autumn as they
could not better occupy. Mr. Titmouse frankly added,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
that he could not avoid acknowledging some little degree
of selfishness in giving the invitation&mdash;namely, in expressing
a hope that the earl's presence would afford him,
if so disposed, an opportunity of introducing his host to
any of the leading members of the county who might be
honored by the earl's acquaintance; that, situated as Titmouse
was, he owned to an increasing anxiety on that
point. He added, that he trusted the earl and Lady
Cecilia would consider Yatton, while they were there, as
in all respects their own residence, and that no exertion
should be wanting to render their stay as agreeable as
possible. The humble appeal of Titmouse prevailed with
his august kinsman; who, on the next day, sent him a
letter saying that his Lordship fully recognized the claims
which Mr. Titmouse had upon him as the head of the
family, and that his Lordship should feel very glad in
availing himself of the opportunity which offered itself,
of placing Mr. Titmouse on a proper footing of intercourse
with the people of the county. That, for this purpose,
His Lordship should decline any invitations they might
receive to pass their autumn elsewhere, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. In
plain English, they jumped (but as decorously as possible)
at the invitation. It had emanated originally from Gammon,
who, from motives of his own, had suggested it to
Titmouse, bade him act upon it, and had drawn up the
letter conveying it. I say, from motives of his own,
Gammon was bent upon becoming personally acquainted
with the earl, and fixing himself, if possible, thoroughly
in his Lordship's confidence. He had contrived to ascertain
from Titmouse, without that gentleman's being, however,
aware of it, that the few occasions on which his
(Gammon's) name had been mentioned by the earl, it
had been accompanied by slighting expressions&mdash;by indications
of even dislike and suspicion. Give him, however,
thought he, but the opportunity, and he could very soon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
change the nature of the earl's feelings towards him. As
soon, therefore, as the earl's acceptance of the invitation
had been communicated to Gammon, he resolved to be
one of the guests at Yatton during the time of the earl's
stay&mdash;a step, into the propriety of which he easily
brought Mr. Quirk to enter, but which he did not, for
the present, communicate to Titmouse, lest he should,
by prematurely disclosing it to the earl, raise any obstacle,
arising out of an objection on the part of his Lordship;
who, if he but found Gammon actually <i>there</i>, must
submit to the infliction with what grace he might. In
due time it was notified on the part of the earl, by his
man of business, to Mr. Titmouse, (who had gone down
to Yatton,) through <i>his</i> man of business, that the earl,
and a formidable portion of his establishment, would
make their appearance at Yatton by a named day. The
earl had chosen to extend the invitation to Miss Macspleuchan
and also to as many attendants as he thought
fit to take with him, instead of letting them consume
their board wages in entire idleness in town or at Poppleton.
Heavens! what accommodation was required, for
the earl, for the Lady Cecilia, each of their personal attendants,
Miss Macspleuchan, and five servants! Then
there were two other guests invited, in order to form
company and amusement for the earl&mdash;the Marquis
Gants-Jaunes de Millefleurs, and a Mr. Tuft. Accommodation
must be had for these; and, to secure it, Mr. Titmouse
and Mr. Gammon were driven to almost the
extremities of the house. Four servants, in a sort of
baggage-wagon, preceded the arrival of the earl and Lady
Cecilia by a day or two, in order to "arrange everything;"
and, somehow or another, one of the first things that was
done with this view, was to install his Lordship's chief
servants in the quarters of Mr. Titmouse's servants, who,
it was suggested, should endeavor to make themselves as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
comfortable as they could in some little unfurnished rooms
over the stables! And, in a word, before Mr. Titmouse's
grand guests had been at the Hall four-and-twenty hours,
there was established there the same freezing state and solemn
ceremony which prevailed in the earl's own establishment.
Down came at length, thundering through the
village, the earl's dusty travelling-carriage and four; himself,
Lady Cecilia, and Miss Macspleuchan within, his
valet and Lady Cecilia's maid behind: presently it wound
round the park road, crashing and flashing through the
gravel, and rattling under the old gateway, and at length
stood before the Hall door&mdash;the reeking horses pulled
up with a sudden jerk, which almost threw them all upon
their haunches. Mr. Titmouse was in readiness to receive
his distinguished visitors; the carriage-door was opened&mdash;down
went the steps&mdash;and in a few moments' time
the proud old Earl of Dreddlington and his proud daughter,
having entered the Hall, had become the guests of
its flustered and ambitious little proprietor. While all
the visitors&mdash;great and small&mdash;are occupied in their
dressing-rooms, recovering themselves from the cramp
and fatigue of a long journey, and are preparing to
make their appearance at dinner, let me take the opportunity
to give you a sketch of the only one of them, of
the smaller sort, to whom you are at present a stranger:
I mean Mr. Tuft&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Venom Tuft</span>.</p>

<p>Oft hath an inexperienced mushroom-hunter, deceived
at a distance, run up to secure what seemed to be a
fine cluster of mushrooms, growing under the shade of
a stately tree, but which, on stooping down to gather
them, he discovers with disappointment and disgust to
be no mushrooms at all, but vile, unwholesome&mdash;even
poisonous funguses: which, to prevent their similarly
deluding others, he kicks up and crushes under foot.
And is not this a type of what often happens in society?
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
Under the "cold shade of aristocracy," how often is to
be met with&mdash;the <small>SYCOPHANT</small>?&mdash;Mr. Venom Tuft was
one of them. His character was written in his face. Disagreeable
to look at&mdash;though <i>he</i> thought far otherwise&mdash;he
yet contrived to make himself pleasant to be listened
to, for a while, by the languid and <i>ennuyé</i> fashionable. He
spoke ever&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"In a <i>toady's</i> key,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bated breath and whispering humbleness."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His person was at once effeminate and coarse; his gesture
and address were cringing&mdash;there was an intolerable calmness
and gentleness about them at all times, but especially
while laboring in his vocation. He had the art of administering
appropriate and acceptable flattery by a look only,
deferential and insinuating&mdash;as well as by words. He
had always at command a copious store of gossip, highly
seasoned with scandal; which he collected and prepared
with industry and judgment. Clever toadies are generally
bitter ones. With sense enough to perceive, but not spirit
enough to abandon their odious propensities, they are aware
of the ignominious spectacle they exhibit before the eyes
of men of the least degree of independence and discernment,
and whose open contempt they have not power
or manliness enough to resent. Then their smothered
rage takes an inward turn; it tends to, and centres in
the tongue, from which it falls in drops of scalding virus; and
thus it is, that the functions of sycophant and
slanderer are so often found united in the same miserable
individual. Does a sycophant fancy that his patron&mdash;if
one may use such a term&mdash;is not aware of his degrading
character and position? Would that he could but hear
himself spoken of by those in whose presence he has last
been prostrating himself! If he could but for one moment
"see himself as others see him"&mdash;surely he would instantly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
wriggle out of the withering sight of man! But
Mr. Tuft was not an everyday toady. Being a clever man,
it occurred to him as calculated infinitely to enhance the
value of his attentions, if he could get them to be regarded
as those of a man of some ability and reputation.
So reasonable a wish, as thus to rise to eminence in the
calling in life to which he had devoted himself&mdash;viz. toadyism&mdash;stimulated
him to considerable exertion, which was
in time rewarded by a measure of success; for he began
to be looked on as <i>something</i> of a literary man. Then he
would spend his mornings in reading up, in those quarters
whence he might cull materials for display in society at
a later period of the day; when he would watch his opportunity,
or, if none presented itself, make one, by diverting
the current of conversation into the channel on
which was the gay and varied bordering of his very recent
acquisitions. All his knowledge was of this gossiping <i>pro
hâc vice</i> character.&mdash;&mdash;He was very skilful in administering
his flattery. Did he dine with his Grace, or his Lordship,
whose speech in the House appeared in that or the
preceding day's newspapers? Mr. Tuft got it up carefully,
and also the speech in answer to it, with a double
view&mdash;to show himself at home in the question! and
then to differ a little with his Grace, or his Lordship, in
order to be presently convinced, and set right by them!
Or when conversation turned upon the topics which had,
over-night, called up his Grace or his Lordship on his legs,
Mr. Tuft would softly break in by observing that such
and such a point had been "admirably put in the debate
by <i>some one</i> of the speakers&mdash;he did not recollect whom;"
and on being apprised of, and receiving a courteous bow
from, the great man entitled to the undesigned compliment,
look <i>so</i> surprised&mdash;almost, indeed, piqued! Carefully,
however, as he managed matters, he was soon found
out by <i>men</i>, and compelled to betake himself, with ten-fold
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
ardor, to the women, with whom he lasted a little
longer. <i>They</i> considered him a great literary man; for
he could quote and criticise a good deal of poetry, and
abuse many novels. He could show that what everybody
else admired was full of faults; what all condemned was admirable:
so that the fair creatures were forced to distrust
their own judgment, in proportion as they deferred to his.
He would allow no one to be entitled to the praise of literary
excellence except individuals of rank, and one or
two men of established literary reputation, who had not
thought it worth their while to repel his obsequious advances,
or convenient not to do so. Then he would polish
the poetry of fine ladies, touch up their little tales, and
secure their insertion in fashionable periodicals. On these
accounts, and of his piquant tittle-tattle, no soirée or conversazione
was complete without him, any more than without
tea, coffee, ice, or lemonade. All toadies hate one
another; but his brethren both hated and feared Mr.
Tuft; for he was not only so successful himself, but possessed
and used such engines for <i>depressing them</i>. Mr.
Tuft had hoped to succeed in being popped in by one of
his patrons for a snug little borough; but the great man
got tired of him, and turned him off, though the ladies of
the family still secured him occasional access to the dinner-table.
He did not, however, make a very grateful return
for such good-natured condescensions. Ugly and ungainly
as he was, he yet imagined himself possessed of personal
attractions for the ladies, and converted their innocent and
unsuspecting familiarities, which had emanated from those
confident in their purity and their elevation, into tokens
of the ascendency he had gained over them; and of which,
with equal cruelty, folly, and presumption, he would afterwards
boast pretty freely. Till this came, however, to be
suspected and discovered, Mr. Tuft visited a good many
leading houses in town, and spent no inconsiderable portion
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
of each autumn at some one or other of the country
mansions of his patrons&mdash;from whose "castles," "halls,"
"abbeys," "priories," and "seats," he took great pride in
dating his letters to his friends. I must not forget to
mention that he kept a book, very gorgeously bound and
embellished, with silver-gilt clasps, and bearing on the back
the words&mdash;"Book of Autographs;" but I should have
written it&mdash;"Trophies of Toadyism." This book contained
autograph notes of the leading nobility, addressed
familiarly to himself, thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Duke of Walworth presents his compliments to Mr.
Tuft, and feels particularly obliged by," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The Duchess of Diamond hopes Mr. Tuft will not forget to
bring with him this evening," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The Marquis of M&mdash;&mdash; has the honor to assure Mr. Tuft
that," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Tuft,</p>

<p>"Why were you not at &mdash;&mdash; House last night? We were
dreadfully dull without you! X &mdash;&mdash; just as stupid as you
always say he <i>is</i>."</p>

<p>[This was from a very pretty and fashionable countess, whose
initials it bore.]</p>

<p>"If Mr. Tuft is dead, Lady Dulcimer requests to be informed
when his funeral will take place, as she, together with a host
of mourners, intends to show him a last mark of respect."</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Tuft,</p>

<p>"The poodle you brought me has got the mange, or some
horrid complaint or other, which is making all his hair fall off.
Do come and tell me what is to be done. Where can I send
the sweet suffering angel?&mdash;Yours,</p>

<div align="right"> <span class="smcap">Arabella D&mdash;&mdash;</span>." </div>

<p>[This was from the eldest and loveliest daughter of a very
great duke.]</p>

<p>"The Lord Chancellor presents his compliments, and begs
to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Venom Tuft's obliging present
of his little '<i>Essay on Greatness</i>.'"</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>These are samples, taken at random, of the contents of
Mr. Tuft's book of autographs, evidencing abundantly the
satisfactory terms of intimacy upon which he lived with
the great; and it was ecstasy to him, to see this glittering
record of his triumphs glanced over by the envious admiring
eyes of those in his own station in society. How
he delighted to be asked about the sayings and doings of
the exclusive circles! How confidentially would he intimate
the desperate condition of a sick peer&mdash;an expected
<i>éclaircissement</i> of some fashionable folly and crime&mdash;or a
move to be made in the Upper House that evening! Poor
Tuft little suspecting (lying so snug in his shell of self-conceit)
how frequently he fell, on these occasions, among
the Philistines&mdash;and was, unconsciously to himself, being
trotted out by a calm sarcastic hypocrite, for the amusement
of the standers-by, just as a little monkey is poked
with a stick to get up and exhibit himself and his tricks.
Such was Mr. Tuft, a great friend and admirer of "the
marquis," through whose influence he had procured the
invitation from Titmouse, in virtue of which he was now
dressing in a nice little room at the back of the Hall,
overlooking the stables; being bent upon improving his
already tolerably familiar acquaintance with the Earl of
Dreddlington and Lady Cecilia, and also extracting from
the man whose hospitality he was enjoying, materials
for merriment among his great friends against the next
season.</p>

<p>When the party had collected in the drawing-room in
readiness for dinner, you might have seen Mr. Tuft in
earnestly respectful conversation with the Lady Cecilia;
Mr. Gammon standing talking to Miss Macspleuchan,
with an air of courteous ease and frankness&mdash;having
observed her sitting neglected by everybody; the earl
conversing now with the marquis, then with Titmouse,
and anon with Tuft, with whom he appeared to be particularly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
pleased. Happening at length to be standing
near Gammon&mdash;a calm, gentlemanlike person of whom
he knew nothing, nor suspected that his keen eye had
taken in his Lordship's true character and capacity at a
glance; nor that he would, in a few hours' time, acquire
as complete a mastery over his said Lordship, as ever the
present famous <i>hippodamist</i> at Windsor,<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> by touching a
nerve in the mouth of a horse, reduces him to helpless
docility and submission&mdash;the earl and he fell into casual
conversation for a moment or two. The air of deference
with which Gammon received the slight advances of the
great man, was exquisite and indescribable. It gave him
clearly to understand that his lofty pretensions were
known to, and profoundly appreciated by, the individual
whom he was addressing. Gammon said but little: that
little, however, how significant and decisive! He knew
that the earl would presently inquire of Titmouse who
the unknown visitor was; and that on being told, in the
conceited and probably disparaging manner which Gammon
knew Titmouse would adopt, if he supposed it would
please the earl, that "it was only Mr. Gammon, one of
his solicitors," he would sink at once and forever beneath
the notice of the earl. He resolved, therefore, to
anticipate&mdash;to contrive that it should ooze out easily
and advantageously from himself, so that he could see
the effect it had upon the earl, and regulate his movements
accordingly. Gammon sat down before the fortress
of the earl's pride, resolved that, for all it appeared so
inaccessible and impregnable, it should fall, however his
skill and patience might be taxed in the siege. Till he
had cast his piercing eye upon the earl, Gammon had
felt a little of the nervousness which one may imagine
would be experienced by Van Amburgh, who, on being
called into the presence of majesty to give a specimen of
his skill upon an animal concealed from him, of whose
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
name and qualities he was ignorant&mdash;should summon
all his terrors into his eye, and string his muscles to their
highest tension; and, on the door being opened, turn
with smiling scorn&mdash;if not indignation&mdash;from a sucking
pig, a calf, an ass, or a chicken. Something similar
were the feelings experienced by Gammon, as soon as he
had scanned the countenance and figure of the Earl of
Dreddlington. He quickly perceived that the dash of
awe which he had thrown into his manner was producing
its due effect upon that most magnificent simpleton.
Watching his opportunity, he gently introduced the topic
of the recent change of ownership which Yatton had
undergone; and in speaking of the manner in which Mr.
Titmouse had borne his sudden prosperity&mdash;"Yes, my
Lord," continued Gammon, with apparent carelessness, "I
recollect making some such observation to him, and he
replied, 'Very true, <i>Mr. Gammon</i>'"&mdash;Gammon finished
his sentence calmly; but he perceived that the earl had
withdrawn himself into his earldom. He had given a
very slight start; a little color had mounted into his
cheek; a sensible hauteur had been assumed, and by the
time that Gammon had done speaking, the space between
them had been&mdash;as Lord Dreddlington imagined, unobservedly&mdash;increased
by two or three inches. Gammon
was a <i>man</i>&mdash;an able and a proud man&mdash;and he felt
galled; but, "let it pass," he presently reflected&mdash;"let
it pass, you pompous old idiot; I will one day repay it
with interest." The earl separated from him, Gammon regarding
him as a gaudy craft sheering off for a while, but
doomed to be soon sunk. Mr. Tuft, (who was the son of
a respectable retired tobacconist,) having ascertained that
Gammon was only Mr. Titmouse's attorney, conducted
himself for a while as though there were no such person
in the room; but being a quick observer, and catching
once or twice the faint sarcastic smile with which Gammon's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
eye was settled on him, he experienced a very
galling and uneasy consciousness of his presence. The
marquis's superior tact and perception of character led
him to treat Gammon very differently&mdash;with a deference
and anxiety to please him, which Gammon understood
thoroughly&mdash;in fact, he and the marquis had many
qualities in common, but Gammon was the man of <i>power</i>.
During dinner he sat beside Miss Macspleuchan, and was
almost the only person who spoke to her&mdash;in fact, he
said but little to any one else. He took wine with Titmouse
with a marked, but guarded, air of <i>confidence</i>. The
marquis took wine with Gammon with an air of studied
courtesy. The earl's attention was almost entirely engrossed
by Mr. Tuft, who sat next to him, chattering in
his ear like a little magpie perched upon his shoulder.
The marquis sat next to the Lady Cecilia; for whose
amusement, as far as his cautious tact would allow him,
he from time to time drew out their little host. At
length, in answer to a question by the marquis, the earl
let fall some pompous observation, from which the marquis,
who was getting very tired of the vapid monotony
which pervaded the table, ventured to differ pretty decisively.
Tuft instantly sided with the earl, and spoke
with infinite fluency for some minutes: Gammon saw in
a moment that he was an absurd pretender; and watching
his opportunity, for the first time that he had interchanged
a syllable with him, with one word exposing a
palpable historical blunder of poor Tuft's, overthrew him
as completely as a bullet from a crossbow dislodges a
tomtit from the wall on which he is hopping about, unconscious
of his danger. 'Twas a thing that there could
be no mistake about whatever.</p>

<p>"That's a <i>settler</i>, Tuft," said the marquis, after a
pause: Tuft reddened violently, and gulped down a glass
of wine; and presently, with the slightly staggered earl,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
became a silent listener to the discussion into which the
marquis and Gammon had entered. Obtuse as was the
earl, Gammon contrived to let him see how effectually
he was supporting his Lordship's opinion, which Mr. Tuft
had so ridiculously failed in. The marquis got slightly
the worst of the encounter with Gammon, whose object
he saw, and whose tact he admired; and with much judgment
permitted Gammon to appear to the earl as his successful
defender, in order that he might himself make a
friend of Gammon. Moreover, he was not at all annoyed
at witnessing the complete and unexpected discomfiture
of poor Tuft, whom, for all his intimacy with that gentleman,
the marquis thoroughly despised.</p>

<p>However it might possibly be that his grand visitors
enjoyed themselves, it was far otherwise with Mr. Titmouse;
who, being compelled to keep sober, was quite
miserable. None of those around him were drinking
men:&mdash;and the consequence was, that he would retire
early to his bedroom, and amuse himself with brandy and
water, and cigars, leaving his guests to amuse themselves
with cards, billiards, or otherwise, as best they might.
He did, indeed, "stand like a cipher in the great account;"
instead of feeling himself the Earl of Dreddlington's
host, he felt himself as one of his Lordship's inferior
guests, struggling in vain against the freezing state and
etiquette which the earl carried with him wherever he
went, like a sort of atmosphere. In this extremity he secretly
clung to Gammon, and reposed upon his powerful
support and sympathy more implicitly than ever he had
done before. As the shooting season had commenced,
and game was plentiful at Yatton, the marquis and Tuft
found full occupation during the day, as occasionally did
Mr. Gammon. Mr. Titmouse once accompanied them;
but having contrived very nearly to blow his own hand
off, and also to blow out the eyes of the marquis, it was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
intimated to him that he had better go out alone for the
future&mdash;as he did accordingly, but soon got tired of such
solitary sport. Besides&mdash;hares, pheasants, partridges&mdash;old
and young, cock or hen&mdash;'twas all one&mdash;none of
them seemed to care one straw for him or his gun, let
him pop and blaze away as loud and as long, as near or
as far off, as he liked. The only thing he hit&mdash;and that
plump&mdash;was one of his unfortunate dogs, which he killed
on the spot; and then coming up with it, stamped upon
the poor creature's bleeding carcass, saying with a furious
oath&mdash;"Why didn't you keep out of the way, then,
you brute?"</p>

<p>The earl was really anxious to perform his promise of
introducing, or procuring introduction for Titmouse, to
the leading nobility and gentry of the county; but it
proved a more difficult task than his Lordship had anticipated&mdash;for
Titmouse's early doings at Yatton had not
yet been forgotten. Some of the haughty Whig gentry
joined with their Tory neighbors in manifesting their open
contempt and dislike, for one who could so disgrace the
name and station to which he had been elevated in the
county; and the earl had to encounter one or two somewhat
mortifying rebuffs, in the course of his efforts for
the establishment of his young kinsman. There were
some, however, whom mere political considerations&mdash;others,
whom deference for the earl's rank, and unwillingness
to hurt his feelings&mdash;induced to receive the new
Squire of Yatton on a footing of formal intimacy and
equality; so that his Lordship's dignified exertions were
not entirely useless. The whole party at the Hall attended
the earl to church on the Sundays&mdash;entirely filling
the squire's pew and the adjoining one; their decorous
conduct presenting a very edifying spectacle to the
humble congregation, and suggesting a striking contrast
between the present, and the former, visitors of Mr. Titmouse.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
Worthy Dr. Tatham was asked several times to
dinner, at the earl's instance; by whom he was treated
on such occasions with great, though stately, courtesy.
The only persons with whom the little doctor felt at
his ease, were Mr. Gammon and Miss Macspleuchan,
who treated him with the utmost cordiality and respect.
What became during the day of the two ladies, I hardly
know. There was no instrument at Yatton: bagatelle-board,
and novels from a circulating library at York, frequent
rides and drives through the grounds and about the
country, and occasional visits to and from one or two families
with whom Lady Cecilia had a town acquaintance,
occupied their day; and in the evening, a rubber at whist,
or écarté, with the earl&mdash;sometimes, too, with the marquis
and Mr. Tuft, both of whom lost no opportunity of
paying marked attention to Lady Cecilia, with a view of
dissipating as far as possible the inevitable ennui of her
situation&mdash;would while away the short evenings, very
early hours being now kept at the Hall. 'Twas wonderful
that two such men as the marquis and Mr. Tuft could
stay so long as they did at so very dull a place, and with
such dull people. Inwardly they both voted the earl an
insufferable old twaddler; his daughter a piece of languid
insipidity; and one would have thought it daily more
irksome for them to keep up their courtly attentions.
They had, however, as may presently be seen, objects of
their own in view.</p>

<p>As Gammon, a little to the earl's surprise, continued apparently
a permanent guest at the Hall, where he seemed
ever engaged in superintending and getting into order the
important affairs of Mr. Titmouse, it could hardly be but
that he and the earl should be occasionally thrown together; for
as the earl did not shoot, and never read books,
even had there been any to read, he had little to do, when
not engaged upon the expeditions I have alluded to, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
saunter about the house and grounds, and enter into frivolous,
but solemn and formal conversation with almost any
one he met. The assistance which Gammon had rendered
the earl on the occasion of their first meeting at dinner, had
not been forgotten by his Lordship, but had served to take
off the edge from his preconceived contemptuous dislike
for that gentleman. Gammon, however, steadily kept
in the background, resolved that all advances should
come from the earl. When, once or twice, his Lordship
inquired, with what Gammon saw to be only an affected
carelessness, into the state of Mr. Titmouse's affairs,
Mr. Gammon evinced a courteous readiness to give him
<i>general</i> information; but with an evident caution and
anxiety, not unduly to expose, even to the earl&mdash;to Mr.
Titmouse's distinguished kinsman, the state of his property.
He would, however, disclose sufficient to demonstrate
his zeal and ability on behalf of Mr. Titmouse's
interests, his consummate qualifications as a man of business;
and from time to time perceived that his display
was not lost upon the earl. Mr. Gammon's anxiety, in
particular, to prevent the borough of Yatton from being
a second time wrested out of the hands of its proprietor,
and returning, by a corrupt and profligate arrangement
with Ministers, a Tory to Parliament, gave the earl peculiar
satisfaction. He was led by the mention of this topic
into a long conversation with Mr. Gammon upon political
matters; and, at its close, was greatly struck with the
soundness of his views, the decision and strength of his
liberal opinions, and the vigor and acuteness with which
he had throughout agreed with everything the earl had
said, and fortified every position he had taken; evincing,
at the same time, a profound appreciation of his Lordship's
luminous exposition of political principles. The
earl was forced to own to himself, that he had never before
met with a man of Mr. Gammon's strength of intellect,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
whose views and opinions had so intimately and
entirely coincided&mdash;were, indeed, identical with his own.
'Twas delightful to witness them upon these occasions&mdash;to
observe the air of reverence and admiration with which
Gammon listened to the lessons of political wisdom which
fell, with increasing length and frequency, from the lips
of his Lordship.</p>

<p class="center">"&#932;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#943; &#7936;&#960;&#8000; &#947;&#955;&#8033;&#963;&#963;&#951;&#962; &#956;&#7953;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#959;&#962;
&#947;&#955;&#965;&#954;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#8164;&#7953;&#949;&#957; &#945;&#8017;&#948;&#8053;."
</p>

<p>Nor was it only when they were alone together, that
Gammon would thus sit at the feet of Gamaliel; he was not
ashamed to do so openly at the dinner-table; but, ah!
how delicately and dexterously did he conceal from the
spectators the game he was playing&mdash;more difficult to
do so, though it daily became&mdash;because, the more willing
Gammon was to receive, the more eager the earl was to
communicate instruction! If, on any of these occasions,
oppressed by the multifariousness of his knowledge, and
its sudden overpowering confluence, he would pause in
the midst of a little series of half-formed sentences, Gammon
would be, at hand, to glide in easily, and finish what
the earl had begun, out of the earl's ample and rich materials,
of which Gammon had caught a glimpse, and only
worked out the earl's own, somewhat numerous, half-formed
illustrations. The marquis and Mr. Tuft began,
however, at length to feel a little impatient at observing
the <i>way</i> which Gammon was making with the earl; but
of what use was it for them to interfere? Gammon was
an exceedingly awkward person to meddle with; for having
once got fair play, by gaining the earl's ear, his accuracy,
readiness, extent of information upon political
topics, and admirable temper, told very powerfully against
his two opponents, who at length interfered less and less
with him; the marquis only <i>feeling</i> pique, but Tuft also
<i>showing</i> it. Had it been otherwise, indeed, with the latter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
gentleman, it would have been odd; for Gammon
seemed to feel a peculiar pleasure in demolishing him.
The marquis, however, once resolved to show Gammon
how distinctly he perceived his plan of operations, by
waiting till he had accompanied the poor earl up to a climax
of absurdity; and then, with his eye on Gammon,
bursting into laughter. Seldom had Gammon been more
ruffled than by that well-timed laugh; for he felt <i>found
out</i>!</p>

<p>When the earl and his astute companion were alone,
the latter would listen with lively interest, over and over
again, never wearied, to his Lordship's magnificent accounts
of what he had intended to do, had he only continued
in office, in the important department over which
he had presided, viz. the Board of Green Cloth; and more
than once put his Lordship into a soft flutter of excitement,
by hinting at rumors which, he said, were rife&mdash;that
in the event of a change of ministers, which was
looked for, his Lordship was to be President of the Council.
"Sir," the earl would say, "I should not shrink
from the performance of my duty to my sovereign, to
whatever post he might be pleased to call me. The one
you mention, sir, has its peculiar difficulties; and if I
know anything of myself, sir, it is one for which&mdash;I
should say&mdash;I am peculiarly qualified. Sir, the duty of
presiding over the deliberations of powerful minds, requires
signal discretion and dignity, because, in short,
especially in affairs of state&mdash;Do you comprehend me,
Mr. Gammon?"</p>

<p>"I understand your Lordship to say, that where the
occasion is one of such magnitude, and the disturbing
forces are upon so vast a scale, to moderate and guide
conflicting interests and opinions"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, it <i>is</i> so; <i>tantas componere lites, hic labor, hoc opus</i>,"
interrupted the earl, with a desperate attempt to fish up
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
a fragment or two of his early scholarship; and his features
wore for a moment a solemn commanding expression,
which satisfied Gammon of the sway which his Lordship
would have had when presiding at the council-board.
Gammon would also occasionally introduce the subject
of heraldry, asking many anxious questions concerning
that exalted science, and also respecting the genealogies
of leading members of the peerage, with which he safely
presumed that the earl would be, as also he proved, perfectly
familiar; and his Lordship would go on for an
hour at once upon these interesting and most instructive
subjects.</p>

<p>Shortly after luncheon one day, of which only Gammon,
the earl, and the two ladies, were in the Hall to
partake, Mr. Gammon had occasion to enter the drawing-room,
where he found the earl sitting upon the sofa, with
his massive gold spectacles on, leaning over the table, engaged
in the perusal of a portion of a work then in course
of periodical publication, and which had only that morning
been delivered at the Hall. The earl asked Gammon
if he had seen it, and was answered in the negative.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the earl, rising and removing his glasses,
"it is a remarkably interesting publication, showing considerable
knowledge of a very difficult and all-important
subject, and one, in respect of which the lower orders of
the people in this country&mdash;nay, I lament to be obliged
to add, the great bulk of the middle classes also, are wofully
deficient&mdash;I mean heraldry, and the history of the
origin, progress, and present state of the families of the
old nobility and gentry of this country." The work which
had been so fortunate as thus to meet with the approbation
of the earl, was the last monthly number of a History
of the County of York, of which, as yet, only thirty-eight
seven-and-sixpenny quarto numbers had made their appearance.
It formed an admirable and instructive publication,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
every number of which had contained a glorification
of some different Yorkshire family. The discriminating
patronage of Mr. Titmouse for this inestimable
performance, had been secured by a most obsequious letter
from the learned editor, but more especially by a device
of his in the last number, which it would have been
strange indeed if it could have failed to catch the eye,
and interest the feelings of the new aristocratical owner
of Yatton. Opposite to an engraving of the Hall, was
placed a magnificent genealogical tree, surmounted by a
many-quartered shield of armorial bearings, both of which
purported to be an accurate record of the ancestral glories
of the house of "<span class="smcap">Titmouse</span> of <span class="smcap">Yatton</span>!" A minute
investigation might indeed have detected that the recent
flight of <i>Titmice</i> which were perched on the lower branches
of this imposing pedigree, bore nearly as small a proportion
to the long array of chivalrous Drelincourts and Dreddlingtons
which constituted the massive trunk, as did the
paternal coat<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (to which the profound research and ingenuity
of Sir <span class="smcap">Gorgeous Tintack</span>, the Garter king-at-arms,
had succeeded in demonstrating the inalienable right of
Titmouse) to the interminable series of quarterings, derived
from the same source, which occupied the remainder
of the escutcheon. At these mysteriously significant
symbols, however, Mr. Titmouse, though quite ready to
believe that they indicated some just cause or other of
family pride, had looked with the same appreciating intelligence
which you may fancy you see a chicken displaying,
while hesitatingly clapping its foot upon, and
quaintly cocking its eye at, a slip of paper lying in a
yard, covered over with algebraic characters and calculations.
Far otherwise, however, was it with the earl, in
whose eyes the complex and recondite character of the
production infinitely enhanced its value, and struck in
his bosom several deep chords of genealogical feeling, as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
he proceeded, in answer to various anxious inquiries of
Gammon, to give him a very full and minute account of
the unrivalled splendor and antiquity of his Lordship's
ancestry. Now be it understood that Gammon&mdash;while
prosecuting the researches which had preceded the elevation
of Mr. Titmouse to that rank and fortune of which
the united voice of the fashionable world had now pronounced
him so eminently worthy&mdash;had made himself
pretty well acquainted with the previous history and connections
of that ancient and illustrious house, of which
the Earl of Dreddlington was the head; and his familiarity
with this topic, though it did not <i>surprise</i> the earl,
because he conceived it to be every one's duty to acquaint
himself with such momentous matters, rapidly
raised Gammon in the good opinion of his Lordship; to
whom at length, it occurred to view him in quite a new
light; viz. as the chosen instrument by whose means
(under Providence) the perverse and self-willed Aubrey
had been righteously cast down from that high place,
which his rebellious opposition to the wishes and political
views of his liege lord had rendered him unworthy
to occupy; while a more loyal branch had been raised
from obscurity to his forfeited rank and estates. In fact,
the earl began to look upon Gammon as one, whose just
regard for his Lordship's transcendent position in the aristocracy
of England had led even to anticipate his Lordship's
possible wishes; and proceeded accordingly to rivet
this spontaneous allegiance, by discoursing with the most
condescending affability on the successive noble and princely
alliances which had, during a long series of generations, refined
the ancient blood of the Drelincourts into the sort
of super-sublimated ichor which at present flowed in his
own veins. The progress of the earl's feelings was watched
with the greatest interest by Mr. Gammon, who perceived
the increasing extent to which respect for him was mingling
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
with his Lordship's sublime self-satisfaction; and,
watching the opportunity, struck a spark into the dry
tinder of his Lordship's vain imagination, blew it gently&mdash;and
saw that it caught and spread. Confident in his
knowledge of the state of affairs, and that his Lordship
had reached the highest point of credulity, Gammon had
the almost incredible audacity to intimate, in a hesitating
but highly significant manner, his impression, that the
recent failure in the male line of the princely house of
<span class="smcap">Hoch-Stiffelhausen Narrenstein Dummleinberg</span><a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> had
placed his Lordship, in right of the marriage of one of his
ancestors, during the Thirty Years' War, with a princess
of that august line, in a situation to claim, if such should
be his Lordship's pleasure, the dormant honors and sovereign
rank attached to the possession of that important
principality. The earl appeared for a few moments transfixed
with awe! The bare possibility of such an event
seemed too much for him to realize; but when further
conversation with Gammon had familiarized his Lordship
with the notion, his mind's eye involuntarily and naturally
glanced to his old rival, the Earl of Fitz-Walter:
what would <i>he</i> say to all this? How would <i>his</i> little
honors pale beside the splendors of his Serene Highness
the Prince of Hoch-Stiffelhausen Narrenstein Dummleinberg!
He was not sorry when Mr. Gammon, soon afterwards,
left him to follow out unrestrainedly the swelling
current of his thoughts, and yield himself up to the transporting
ecstasies of anticipated sovereignty. To such a
pitch did his excitement carry him, that he might shortly
afterwards have been seen walking up and down the Elm
Avenue, with the feelings and air of an old <span class="smcap">King</span>.</p>

<p>Not satisfied, however, with the success of his daring
experiment upon the credulity and inflammable imagination
of the aspiring old nobleman&mdash;whom his suggestion
had set upon instituting extensive inquiries into the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
position of the Dreddlington family with reference to the
foreign alliances which it had formed in times past, and
of which so dazzling an incident might really be in existence&mdash;it
occurred to Mr. Gammon, on another occasion
of his being left alone with the earl, and who, he saw,
was growing manifestly more pleased with the frequent
recurrence of them, to sink a shaft into a new mine. He
therefore, on mere speculation, introduced, as a subject
of casual conversation, the imprudence of persons of rank
and large fortune devolving the management of their
pecuniary affairs so entirely upon others&mdash;and thus
leaving themselves exposed to all the serious consequences
of employing incompetent, indolent, or mercenary
agents. Mr. Gammon proceeded to observe that he
had recently known an instance of a distinguished nobleman,
(whose name&mdash;oh, Gammon!&mdash;he for very obvious
reasons suppressed,) who, having occasion to raise
a large sum of money by way of mortgage, left the sole
negotiation of the affair to an agent, who was afterwards
proved to have been in league with the lender, (the mortgagee,)
and had permitted his employer to pay, for ten
or twelve years, an excess of interest over that for which
he might, had he chosen, have obtained the requisite
loan, which actually made a difference in the distinguished
borrower's income of a thousand a-year! Here,
looking out of the northeast corner of his eye, the placid
speaker, continuing unmoved, observed the earl start a
little, glance somewhat anxiously at him, but in silence,
and slightly quicken the pace at which he had been walking.
Gammon presently added, in a careless sort of way,
that accident had brought him into professional intercourse
with that nobleman&mdash;[Oh, Gammon! Gammon!]&mdash;whom
he was ultimately instrumental in saving from
the annual robbery which was being inflicted upon him.
It was enough; Gammon saw that what he had been saying
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
had sunk like lead into the mind of his noble and
acute companion, who, for the rest of the day, seemed
burdened and oppressed with either it or some other
cause of anxiety; and, from an occasional uneasy and
wistful eye which the earl fixed upon him at dinner, he
felt conscious that not long would elapse, before he should
hear something from the earl connected with the topic in
question&mdash;and he was not mistaken. The very next
day they met in the park; and after one or two casual
observations, the earl remarked that, by the way, with
reference to their yesterday's conversation, it "<i>did so
happen</i>"&mdash;very singularly&mdash;that the earl had a friend
who was placed in a situation very similar to that which
had been mentioned by Mr. Gammon to the earl; it was
a <i>very intimate</i> friend&mdash;and therefore the earl would like
to hear what was Mr. Gammon's opinion of the case.
Gammon was scarcely able to refrain from a smile, as the
earl went on, evincing every moment a more vivid interest
in behalf of his mysterious "<i>friend</i>," who at last stood suddenly
confessed as the Earl of Dreddlington himself; for
in answer to a question of Mr. Gammon, his Lordship unwittingly
spoke <i>in the first person</i>! On perceiving this,
he got much confused; but Gammon passed it off very
easily; and by his earnest confidential tone and manner,
soon soothed and reconciled the earl to the vexatious disclosure
he had made&mdash;vexatious only because the earl
had thought fit, so very unnecessarily, to make a mystery
of an everyday matter. He rather loftily enjoined
Mr. Gammon to secrecy upon the subject, to which Gammon
readily pledged himself, and then they entered upon
an unrestrained discussion of the matter. Suffice it to
say, that in the end Gammon assured the earl that he
would, without any difficulty, undertake to procure a
transfer of the mortgage at present existing on his Lordship's
property, which should lower his annual payments
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
by at least one and a half per cent: and which, on a
rough calculation, would make a difference of very nearly
five hundred a-year in the earl's favor. But Gammon
explicitly informed the earl that he was not to suppose
that he had been overreached, or his interests been in
any way neglected, in the original transaction; that it
had been conducted on his Lordship's behalf, by his solicitor,
Mr. Mudge, one of the most respectable men in the
profession; and that a few years made all the difference
in matters of this description; and before he, Mr. Gammon,
would interfere any further in the business, he requested
his Lordship to write to Mr. Mudge, enclosing a
draft of the arrangement proposed by Mr. Gammon, and
desiring Mr. Mudge to say what he thought of it. This
the earl did; and in a few days' time received an answer
from Mr. Mudge, to the effect that he was happy that
there was a prospect of so favorable an arrangement as
that proposed, to which he could see no objection whatever;
and would co-operate with Mr. Gammon in any
way, and at any time, which his Lordship might point
out. Mr. Gammon was, in fact, rendering here a real
and very important service to the earl; being an able,
acute, and energetic man of business&mdash;while Mr. Mudge
was very nearly superannuated&mdash;had grown rich and
indolent, no longer attending to his practice with pristine
energy; but <i>pottering</i> and dozing over it, as it were,
from day to day; unable, from his antiquated style of
doing business, and the constantly narrowing circle of his
connections, to avail himself of those resources which
were open to younger and more energetic practitioners,
with more varied resources. Thus, though money was
now much more plentiful, and consequently to be got for
a less sum than when, some ten years before, the earl had
been compelled to borrow to a large amount upon mortgage,
old Mr. Mudge had suffered matters to remain all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
the while as they were; and so they <i>would</i> have remained,
but for Gammon's accidental interference: the
earl being not a man of business&mdash;one who could not
bear to allude to the fact of his property being mortgaged&mdash;who
did not like even to <i>think</i> of it; and concluded
that good old Mr. Mudge kept a sufficiently sharp eye
upon his noble client's interest. The earl gave Mr.
Mudge's letter to Mr. Gammon, and requested him to
lose no time in putting himself into communication with
Mr. Mudge, for the purpose of effecting the suggested
transfer. This Gammon undertook to do; and perceiving
that he had fortunately made so strong a lodgement
in the earl's good opinion, whose interests now bound
him, in a measure, to Mr. Gammon, that gentleman
thought that he might safely quit Yatton and return to
town, in order to attend to divers matters of pressing exigency.
Before his departure, however, he had a very
long interview with Titmouse, in the course of which he
gave that now submissive personage a few simple, perspicuous,
and decisive directions, as to the line of conduct
he was to pursue, and which alone could conduce to his
permanent interests: enjoining him, moreover, to pursue
that line, on terror of the consequences of failing to do
so. The Earl of Dreddlington, in taking leave of Mr.
Gammon, evinced the utmost degree of cordiality consistent
with the stateliness of his demeanor. He felt, in
fact, real regret at parting with a man of such superior
intellect&mdash;one evincing such a fascinating deference
towards himself, (the earl:) and it glanced across his
Lordship's mind, that such a man as Mr. Gammon would
be the very fittest man who could be thought of, in respect
of tact, energy, and knowledge, to become prime
minister to&mdash;his Serene Highness the Prince of Hoch-Stiffelhausen
Narrenstein Dummleinberg!</p>

<p>The longer that the earl continued at Yatton&mdash;in which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
he could not have more thoroughly established himself if
he had in the ordinary way engaged it for the autumn&mdash;the
more he was struck with its beauties; and the oftener
they presented themselves to his mind's eye, the keener
became his regrets at the split in the family interests
which had so long existed, and his desire to take advantage
of what seemed almost an opportunity, specially afforded
by Providence, for reuniting them. As the earl
took his solitary walks, he thought with deep anxiety of
his own advanced age, and sensibly increasing feebleness.
The position of his affairs was not satisfactory. When
he died, he would leave behind him an only child&mdash;and
that a daughter&mdash;on whom would devolve the splendid
responsibility of sustaining, alone, the honors of her
ancient family. Then there was his newly discovered
kinsman, Mr. Titmouse, sole and unembarrassed proprietor
of this fine old family property; simple-minded and confiding,
with a truly reverential feeling towards them, the
heads of the family; also the undoubted, undisputed proprietor
of the borough of Yatton; who entertained and
avowed the same liberal and enlightened political opinions,
which the earl had ever maintained with dignified consistency
and determination; and who, by a rare conjunction
of personal merit and of circumstance, had been elevated
to an unprecedented pitch of popularity, in the highest
regions of society; and who was, moreover, already next
in succession, after himself and the Lady Cecilia, to the
ancient barony of Drelincourt and the estates annexed to
it. How little was there, in reality, to set against all
this? An eccentricity of manner, for which nature only,
if any one, was to blame; a tendency to extreme modishness
in dress, and a slight deficiency in the knowledge of
the etiquette of society, but which daily experience and intercourse
were rapidly supplying; and a slight disposition
towards the pleasures of the table, which no doubt would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
disappear on the instant of his having an object of permanent
and elevating attachment. Such was Mr. Titmouse.
He had as yet, undoubtedly, made no advances to Lady
Cecilia, nor evinced any disposition to do so, though numerous
and favorable had been, and continued to be, the
opportunities for his doing so. Might not this, however, be
set down entirely to the score of his excessive diffidence&mdash;distrust
of his pretensions to aspire after so august an alliance
as that with the Lady Cecilia? Yet there certainly
was another way of accounting for his conduct: had he
got already entangled with an attachment elsewhere?&mdash;Run
after in society, as he had been, in a manner totally
unprecedented during his very first season&mdash;had his affections
been inveigled?&mdash;When the earl dwelt upon this
dismal possibility, if it were when he was lying awake in
bed, he would be seized with a fit of intolerable restlessness&mdash;and
getting up, wrap himself in his dressing-gown,
and pace his chamber for an hour together, running over,
in his mind, the names of all the women he knew who
would be likely to lay snares for Titmouse, in order to secure
him for a daughter. Then there was the Lady Cecilia&mdash;but
she, he knew, would not run counter to his
wishes, and he had, therefore, no difficulty to apprehend
on <i>that</i> score. She had ever been calmly submissive to his
will; had the same lofty sense of family dignity that he
enjoyed; and had often concurred in his deep regrets on
account of the separation of the family interests. She
was still unmarried&mdash;and yet, on her father's decease,
would be a peeress in her own right, and possessed of the
family estates. The fastidiousness which alone, thought
the earl, had kept her hitherto single, would not, he felt
persuaded, be allowed by her to interfere, for the purpose
of preventing so excellent a family arrangement as would
be effected by her union with Titmouse. Once married&mdash;and
being secured suitable settlements from Titmouse&mdash;if
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
there should prove to be any incompatibility of temper
or discrepancy of disposition, come the worst to the worst,
there was the shelter of a separation and separate maintenance
to look to; a thing which was becoming of daily
occurrence&mdash;which implied no real reproach to either
party&mdash;and left them always at liberty to return to each
other's society&mdash;when so disposed. And as for the dress
and manners of Titmouse, granting them to be a little extravagant,
would not, in all probability, a word from her
suffice to dispel his fantastic vulgarity&mdash;to elevate him
into a gentleman? Thus thought her fond and enlightened
parent, and thus&mdash;in point of fact&mdash;thought also
she; from which it is evident, that Titmouse, once
brought to the point&mdash;made sensible where his duty and
his privilege converged&mdash;it would be a straightforward
plain-sailing business. To bring about so desirable a
state of things as this&mdash;to give the young people an opportunity
of thoroughly knowing and endearing themselves
to each other, were among the objects which the
earl had proposed to himself, in accepting the invitation
to Yatton. Time was wearing on, however, and yet no
decisive step had been taken. Lady Cecilia's icy coldness&mdash;her
petrifying indifference of manner, her phlegmatic
temperament and lofty pride, were qualities, all of which
were calculated rather to check than encourage the advances
of a suitor, especially of such an one as Titmouse;
but, though the earl did not know it, there were others
whose ardor and impatience to possess themselves of such
superior loveliness, could not be similarly restrained or
discouraged. Will not the reader find it difficult to believe,
that Mr. Venom Tuft, having been long on the
look-out for&mdash;Heaven save the mark!&mdash;an aristocratic
wife, had conceived it not impossible to engage the affections
of Lady Cecilia&mdash;to fascinate her by the display of
his brilliant acquirements; and that the comparative seclusion
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
of Yatton would afford him the requisite opportunity
for effecting his wishes? Yet even so it really was:
intoxicated with vanity, which led him to believe himself
peculiarly agreeable to women, he at length had the inconceivable
folly and presumption, on the morning after
an evening in which he fancied that he had displayed peculiar
brilliance, to intimate to her that his affections were
no longer under his own control, having been taken captive
by her irresistible charms. Vain thought! as well
might a cock-sparrow have sought to mate himself with
the stately swan! It was for some time rather difficult
for the Lady Cecilia to understand that he was seriously
making her a proposal. At length, however, she comprehended
him: evincing the utmost degree of astonishment
which her drooping eyelids and languid hauteur of manner
would permit her to manifest. When poor Tuft
found that such was the case, his face burned like fire,
and he felt in a fierce fluster within.</p>

<p>"You haven't mistaken me for Miss Macspleuchan, Mr.
Tuft, have you?" said Lady Cecilia, with a faint smile.
"You and Mr. Titmouse and the marquis, I hear, sat
much longer after dinner last night than usual!" Tuft
was utterly confounded. Was her Ladyship insinuating
that he was under the influence of wine? He was for a
while speechless.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Lady Cecilia"&mdash;&mdash;at length stammered
he.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;now I understand!&mdash;You are rehearsing for
Lady Tawdry's private theatricals? Do you play there
next month? Well, I dare say you'll make a delicious
Romeo." Here the earl happening to enter, Lady Cecilia,
with a languid smile, apprised him that Mr. Tuft had
been rehearsing, to admiration, a love-scene which he was
studying for Lady Tawdry's theatricals; on which the
earl, in a good-natured way, said that he should like to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
witness it, if not too much trouble to Mr. Tuft. If that
gentleman could have crept up the chimney without
being observed, he would have employed the first moment
of sooty repose and security, in praying that the
Lady Cecilia might bring herself to believe, that he had
really been doing what at present he feared she only
affected to believe, viz. that he had been only playing at
love-making. He resolved to outstay the earl, who, indeed,
withdrew in a few minutes' time, having entered
only for the purpose of asking Lady Cecilia a question;
and on her Ladyship and her would-be lover being again
alone&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I have been guilty of presumption, Lady Cecilia"&mdash;&mdash;commenced
Tuft, with tremulous earnestness, looking
a truly piteous object.</p>

<p>"Not the least, Mr. Tuft," said she, calmly smiling; "or,
even if you <i>have</i>, I'll forgive it on one condition"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your Ladyship has only to intimate"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That you will go through it all with Miss Macspleuchan;
or, couldn't we get up a sweet scene with my
maid? Annette is a pretty little thing, and her broken
English"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your Ladyship is pleased to be exceedingly severe;
but I feel that I deserve it. Still, knowing your Ladyship's
good-nature, I will venture to ask one great favor,
which, if you refuse, I will within an hour quit Yatton;
that your Ladyship will, in mercy to my feelings, mention
this little scene to no one."</p>

<p>"If you wish it, Mr. Tuft, I will preserve your secret,"
she replied in a kinder and more serious manner than he
had ever witnessed in her; and, when he had escaped
into solitude, he could hardly tell whom he hated most&mdash;himself,
or the Lady Cecilia. Several days afterwards,
the Marquis Gants-Jaunes de Millefleurs, purposing to
quit Yatton on his way northward, sought a favorable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
opportunity to lay himself&mdash;the brilliant, irresistible
marquis&mdash;at the feet of the all-conquering Lady Cecilia,
the future Lady Drelincourt, peeress in her own right,
and mistress of the family estates. He had done the
same kind of thing half a dozen times to as many women&mdash;all
of them of ample fortune, and most of them also of
rank. His manner was exquisitely delicate and winning;
but Lady Cecilia, with a slight blush, (for she was really
pleased,) calmly refused him. He saw it was utterly in
vain; and for a few moments felt in an unutterably foolish
position. Quickly recovering himself, however, he
assumed an air of delicate raillery, and put her into such
good humor, that, forgetful in the moment of her promise
to poor Tuft, she, in the "strictest confidence in the
world," communicated to the marquis the offer which
Mr. Tuft had been beforehand with him in making to
her! The marquis's cheek flushed and tingled; and,
without being able to analyze what passed through his
mind, the result may be stated as an intolerable feeling,
that he and Tuft were a couple of sneaking adventurers,
and worse&mdash;of ridiculous and exposed adventurers. For
almost the first time in his life, he felt such an embarrassment
amid the momentary conflict of his thoughts and
feelings, as kept him silent. At length, "I presume,
Lady Cecilia," said he, in a low tone, with an air of distress,
and a glance which did more in his behalf with
Lady Cecilia than a thousand of his most flattering and
eloquent speeches, "that I shall, in like manner, afford
amusement to your Ladyship and Mr. Tuft?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said she, haughtily, and coloring&mdash;"Mr. Tuft
and the Marquis Gants-Jaunes de Millefleurs, are two
very different persons. I am surprised, Monsieur le Marquis,
that you should have made such an observation!"</p>

<p>Hereupon he felt greatly consoled, and perfectly secure
against being exposed to Tuft, as Tuft had been exposed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
to him. Yet he was mistaken. How can the reader forgive
Lady Cecilia for her double breach of promise, when
he is informed, that only a day or two afterwards, Tuft
and she being thrown together, partly out of pity to
her rejected and bitterly mortified suitor, partly from an
impulse of womanly vanity, and partly from a sort of
glimpse of even-handed justice requiring such a step, as
a kind of reparation to Tuft for her exposure of him to
the marquis&mdash;she ("in the strictest confidence," however)
informed him that his example had been followed by the
marquis; utterly forgetful of that excellent maxim, "begin
nothing of which you have not well considered the
end." It had not occurred to her Ladyship as being a
thing almost certain to ensue upon her breach of faith,
that Tuft would ask her whether she had violated <i>his</i> confidence.
He did so: she blushed scarlet&mdash;and though,
like her august papa, she could have <i>equivocated</i> when she
could not have <i>lied</i>, here she was in a dilemma from which
nothing but a fib could possibly extricate her; and in a
confident tone, but with a burning cheek, she told a falsehood,
and had, moreover, the pain of being conscious, by
Mr. Tuft's look, that he did not believe her.&mdash;Nothing
could exceed the comical air of embarrassment of the marquis
and Mr. Tuft, whenever, after this, they were alone
together! How fearful lest&mdash;how doubtful whether&mdash;each
knew as much as the other!</p>

<p>To return, however, to the Earl of Dreddlington, (who
was utterly in ignorance of the marquis and Mr. Tuft's
proposals to Lady Cecilia,) the difficulty which at present
harassed his Lordship was, how he could, without compromising
his own dignity, or injuring his darling scheme
by a premature development of his purpose, sound Titmouse
upon the subject. How to break the ice&mdash;to
broach the affair&mdash;was the great problem which the earl
turned over and over again in his mind. Now, be it observed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
that when a muddle-headed man is called upon at
length <i>to act</i>&mdash;however long beforehand he may have had
notice of it&mdash;however assured he may have been of the
necessity for eventually taking one course or another, and
consequently, however ample the opportunity had for consideration,
he remains confused and irresolute up to the
very <i>last instant</i>&mdash;when he acts, after all, merely as the
creature of caprice and impulse! 'Twas thus with Lord
Dreddlington. He had thought of half a dozen different
ways of commencing with Titmouse, and decided upon
adopting each; yet, on the arrival of the anxiously looked
for moment, he had lost sight of them all, in his inward
fluster and nervousness.</p>

<p>'Twas noon, and Titmouse, smoking a cigar, was walking
slowly up and down, his hands stuck into his surtout
pockets, and resting on his hips, in the fir-tree walk at
the end of the garden&mdash;the spot to which he seemed,
during the stay of his grand guests, to have been tacitly
restricted for the enjoyment of the luxury in question.
As soon as Titmouse was aware of the earl's approach, he
hastily tossed aside his cigar. The earl "begged" he
would take another; and tried to calm and steady himself,
by a moment's reflection upon his overwhelming superiority
over Titmouse in every respect; but it was in vain.</p>

<p>Now&mdash;to pause for a moment&mdash;what anxiety and embarrassment
would not his Lordship have been spared, had
he been aware of one little fact; viz. that Mr. Gammon
was unconsciously, secretly, and potently, his friend, in
the great matter which lay so near to his heart? For so,
in truth, it was. He had used all the art he was master
of, and availed himself of all his mysterious power over
Titmouse, to get him to make, at all events, an <i>advance</i> to
his distinguished kinswoman. Considering, however, how
necessary it was "to be off with the old love before he
was on with the new," he had commenced operations by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
satisfying Titmouse how vain and hopeless, and, indeed,
unworthy of him, was his passion for poor Miss Aubrey.
Here, however, Gammon had not so much difficulty to
contend with as he had anticipated; for Miss Aubrey's
image had been long ago jostled out of Titmouse's recollection,
by the innumerable brilliant and fashionable women
among whom he had been latterly thrown. When,
therefore, Gammon veraciously informed him that Miss
Aubrey had <i>fallen into a decline</i>! and that, moreover,
when he (Gammon) had, according to his promise to
Titmouse, taken an opportunity of pressing his wishes
upon her, she had scornfully scouted the bare notion of
such a thing!</p>

<p>"'Pon&mdash;my soul! The&mdash;devil&mdash;she did!" said
Titmouse, with an air of insolent astonishment. "The
gal's a devilish pretty gal, no doubt," he presently continued,
knocking the ashes off his cigar with an indifferent
air; "but&mdash;it's too good a joke&mdash;'pon my soul it is;
but d' ye think, Gammon, she ever supposed I <i>meant</i> marriage?
By Jove!" Here he winked his eye at Gammon,
and then slowly expelled a mouthful of smoke. Gammon
had grown pale with the conflict excited within him, by
the last words of the execrable little miscreant. He controlled
his feelings, however, and succeeded in preserving
silence.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;well!" continued Titmouse, after another whiff
or two, with an air of commiseration, "if the poor gal's
<i>booked</i> for kingdom come&mdash;eh? it's no use; there's no
harm done. Deuced poor, all of 'em, I hear! It's
devilish hard, by the way, Gammon, that the prettiest
gals are always the soonest picked off for the churchyard!"
As soon as Gammon had completely mastered
his feelings, he proceeded to excite the pride and ambition
of Titmouse, by expatiating upon the splendor of an
alliance with the last representative of the elder branch
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
of so ancient and illustrious a house; in fact, when
Gammon came, he said, to think of it, he feared it was
<i>too</i> grand a stroke, and that Lady Cecilia would not entertain
the notion for a moment. He told Titmouse that
she had refused crowds of young lords: that she would
be a peeress of the realm in her own right, with an independent
income of £5,000 a-year; and have mansions,
seats, and castles, in each of the four quarters of the
kingdom! Topics such as these excited and inflated Titmouse
to the full extent desired by Mr. Gammon; who,
moreover, with great solemnity of manner, gave him distinctly
to understand, that on his being able to effect an
alliance with the Lady Cecilia, absolutely depended his
continuance in, or expulsion from, the possession of the
whole Yatton property.  Thus it came to pass, that
Titmouse was penetrated by a far keener desire to
ally himself to the Lady Cecilia, than ever the earl had
experienced to bring about such an auspicious event;
and at the very moment of Titmouse's catching sight of
the earl, while pacing up and down the fir-tree walk,
inhaling the soothing influence of his cigar&mdash;as I a short
time ago presented him to the reader&mdash;he was tormenting
himself with apprehensions that such a prize was
too splendid for <i>him</i> to draw, and asking himself the constantly
recurring question, how, in the name of all that
was funny, could he set the thing a-going?  When Greek
met Greek, <i>then</i> came&mdash;it was said&mdash;the tug of war:
and when the Earl of Dreddlington and Titmouse&mdash;a
great fool and a little fool?&mdash;came to meet each other,
impelled by the same wishes, and restrained by similar
apprehensions, it was like the encounter of two wily diplomatists,
sitting down with the intention of outwitting
each other, in obtaining an object, in respect of which
their aim was, in fact&mdash;unknown to each other&mdash;precisely
coincident; this hidden coincidence being the exact
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
point which their exquisite man&#339;uvres had succeeded in
reciprocally masking: it being quite possible for Talleyrand
and Pozzo di Borgo, thus pitted against each other,
to have separated, after a dozen long conferences, each
having failed to secure their common object&mdash;peace.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Titmouse"&mdash;commenced the earl, blandly,
stepping at once, with graceful boldness, out of the mist,
confusion, and perplexity which prevailed among his Lordship's
ideas, few as they were&mdash;"<i>what are you thinking
about</i>?&mdash;For you <i>seem</i> to be thinking!" and a courteous
little laugh accompanied the last words.</p>

<p>"'Pon&mdash;'pon my life&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;<i>beg</i> your Lordship's
pardon&mdash;but it's&mdash;monstrous odd your Lordship should
have known it"&mdash;stammered Titmouse; and his face
suddenly grew of a scarlet color.</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the earl, with greater skill than he had
ever evinced in his whole life before&mdash;(such is the effect
of any one's being intensely <i>in earnest</i>)&mdash;"it is not at all
odd, when it happens that&mdash;the probability is&mdash;that&mdash;we
are, perhaps&mdash;mind, sir, I mean possibly&mdash;thinking
<i>about the same thing</i>!" Titmouse grew more and more confused,
gazing in silence, with a strange simpering stare,
at his noble companion, who, with his hands joined behind
him, was walking slowly along with Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Sir," continued the earl, in a low tone&mdash;breaking a
very awkward pause&mdash;"it gives me sincere satisfaction
to assure you, that I can fully appreciate the delicate
embarrassment which I perceive you are now"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Lord&mdash;your Lordship's most <i>uncommon</i> polite"&mdash;quoth
Titmouse, suddenly taking off his hat, and bowing
very low. The earl moved his hat also, and slightly
bowed, with a proudly gratified air; and again occurred
a pause, which was broken by Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Then your Lordship thinks&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;that&mdash;<i>it will
do</i>?" he inquired very sheepishly, but anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir, I have the honor to assure you, that as far as I
am concerned, I see no obst"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but excuse me, my Lord&mdash;your Lordship sees&mdash;I
mean&mdash;my Lord, your Lordship sees&mdash;&mdash;doesn't
your Lordship?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I think&mdash;nay, I believe I <i>do</i>"&mdash;interrupted the
earl, wishing to relieve the evident embarrassment of his
companion&mdash;"but&mdash;I see&mdash;nothing that should&mdash;alarm
you."</p>

<p>[How interesting to watch the mysterious process by
which these two powerful minds were gradually approximating
towards understanding each other! 'Twas a sort
of <i>equation</i> with an unknown quantity, in due course of
elimination!]</p>

<p>"Doesn't your Lordship, indeed?" inquired Titmouse,
rather briskly.</p>

<p>"Sir, it was a saying of one of the great&mdash;I mean, sir,
it is&mdash;you must often have heard, sir&mdash;in short, <i>nothing
venture, nothing have</i>!"</p>

<p>"I'd venture a precious deal, my Lord, if I only thought
I could get what <i>I'm</i> after!"</p>

<p>"Sir?" exclaimed the earl, condescendingly.</p>

<p>"If your Lordship would only be so particular&mdash;so
uncommon kind&mdash;as to name the thing to her Ladyship&mdash;by
way of&mdash;eh, my Lord? A sort of breaking the ice,
and all that"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, I feel and have a just pride in assuring you, that
the Lady Cecilia is a young lady of that superior delicacy
of"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Does</i> your Lordship really think I've a <i>ghost</i> of a
chance?" interrupted Titmouse, anxiously. "<i>She</i> must
have named the thing to your Lordship, no doubt&mdash;eh,
my Lord?"</p>

<p>This queer notion of the young lady's delicacy a little
staggered her distinguished father for a moment or two.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
What was he to say? She and he had really often named
the thing to each other; and here the question was put
to him plumply. The earl scorned a flat lie, and never
condescended to equivocation except when it was absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said hesitatingly; "undoubtedly&mdash;If I were
to say&mdash;that now and then, when your attentions have
been so pointed"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, my Lord, I never meant it; if your
Lordship will only believe me," interrupted Titmouse,
earnestly; "I beg a thousand pardons&mdash;I mean no
harm, my Lord."</p>

<p>"Sir, there is no harm done," said the earl, kindly.
"Sir, I know human nature too well, or I have lived
thus long to little purpose, not to be aware that we are
not always master of our own feelings."</p>

<p>"That's exactly it, my Lord! Excuse me, but your
Lordship's hit the thing off to a T, as folks say!"</p>

<p>"Do not imagine, Mr. Titmouse, that I think your attentions
may have been <i>unpleasant</i> to the Lady Cecilia&mdash;by
no means; I cannot, with truth, say any such
thing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord!" exclaimed Titmouse, taking off his
hat, bowing, and placing his hand upon his breast, where
his little heart was palpitating with unusual force and
distinctness.</p>

<p>"<i>Faint heart</i>, says the proverb, Mr. Titmouse, ah, ha!"
quoth the earl, with gentle gayety.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord, it's enough to make one faint indeed!
Now, if your Lordship&mdash;(I'm not used to this sort of
thing, my Lord)&mdash;would just make a sort of beginning
for me, my Lord, with the Lady Cicely, to set us going,
my Lord&mdash;the least shove would do, my Lord&mdash;because,
my Lord, <i>courtship's</i> a very&mdash;a&mdash;a"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Titmouse," said the earl, with a gracious
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
smile, "since your modesty is so overpowering&mdash;I'll try&mdash;to
become your ambassador to the Lady Cecilia. If,
Mr. Titmouse," his Lordship presently added in a serious
tone, "you are fortunate enough to succeed in engaging
the affections of the Lady Cecilia, you will discover that
you have secured indeed an invaluable prize."</p>

<p>"To be sure, my Lord! And consider, too, her Ladyship's
uncommon high rank&mdash;it's so particular condescending.&mdash;By
the way, my Lord, will she&mdash;if she and I
can hit it off, so as to marry one another&mdash;be called <i>Mrs.
Titmouse</i>, or shall I be called <i>Lord Titmouse</i>? I wonder
how that will be, my Lord? 'Tis only, your Lordship
understands, on Lady Cicely's account I ask, because it's,
in course, all one to <i>me</i> when once we're married."</p>

<p>The earl was gazing at him as he went on, with an expression
of mingled surprise and concern: presently, however,
he added with calm seriousness, "Sir, it is not an
unreasonable question, though I should have imagined
that you could hardly&mdash;be&mdash;but&mdash;in short, the Lady
Cecilia will retain her rank, and become the Lady Cecilia
Titmouse&mdash;that is, during my life; but on my demise,
she succeeds to the barony of Drelincourt, and then will
be called, of course, Lady Drelincourt."</p>

<p>"And what shall <i>I</i> be then, my Lord?" inquired Titmouse,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Sir, you will of course continue Mr. Titmouse."</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, my Lord&mdash;shall I indeed?" he interrupted
with a crestfallen air, "must we be called <i>Mr.
Titmouse and Lady Drelincourt</i>? Excuse me, my Lord,
but it don't sound at all like man and wife."</p>

<p>"Sir, so it always has been, and will be, and so it ever
ought to be," replied the earl, gravely.</p>

<p>"Well but, my Lord, (excuse me, my Lord)&mdash;but marriage
is a very serious thing, my Lord, your Lordship
knows"&mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is, sir, indeed," replied the earl, gloom visibly overspreading
his features.</p>

<p>"Suppose," continued Titmouse, "Lady Cicely should
die before me?"</p>

<p>The earl, remaining silent, fixed on Titmouse the eye
of a <small>FATHER</small>&mdash;a father, though a very foolish one; and
presently, with a sensible tremor in his voice, replied,
"Sir, these are rather singular questions&mdash;but," he
paused for some moments&mdash;"in such a mournful contingency
as the one you have hinted at"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord! I humbly beg pardon&mdash;of course,
I should be, 'pon my soul, my Lord, most uncommon
sorry"&mdash;interrupted Titmouse, with a little alarm in
his manner.</p>

<p>"I was saying, sir&mdash;that in such an event, if Lady
Drelincourt left no issue, you would succeed to the
barony; but should she leave issue, they will be called
Honorable"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;'the Honorable Tittlebat Titmouse,' if it's
a boy, and the 'Honorable Cecilia Titmouse,' if it's a
girl?"</p>

<p>"Sir, it will be so&mdash;unless you should choose to take
the name and arms of Dreddlington, on marrying the sole
heiress"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! indeed, my Lord? 'Pon my life, my Lord,
<i>that's</i> worth considering&mdash;because&mdash;betwixt your Lordship
and I, I a'n't over and above pleased with my
own name. What will it cost to change it, now, my
Lord?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said the earl, struck with the idea, "that is
really a thing worth considering. But as for the <i>expense</i>&mdash;in
an affair of such magnitude, sir, I presume it would
not be a matter of serious consideration."</p>

<p>After some further conversation, the earl came plump
upon the great pivot upon which the whole arrangement
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
was to turn&mdash;settlements and jointures&mdash;oh, as to them,
Titmouse, who was recovering from the shock of the discovery
that his marriage, however it might degrade the
Lady Cecilia, would not ennoble him&mdash;promised everything&mdash;would
leave everything in the hands of his Lordship.
Soon afterwards they separated; the earl suggesting
to him, that probably in a matter of infinite delicacy, like
that on which they had been conversing, he would keep
his own counsel&mdash;to which also Titmouse pledged himself.
Soon afterwards, and before seeing his daughter,
with an anxious, but not an excited air, he ordered his
horse, and took a long ride, accompanied only by his
groom: and if ever in his whole life he had attempted
serious <small>REFLECTION</small>, it was on the occasion of that same
long, slow, and solitary ride; then, for the first time, he
forgot his peerage, and thought only of the <i>man</i>&mdash;and
the father.</p>

<p>But to what purpose? Shortly after his return, he
sought the Lady Cecilia, and performed his promise, by
preparing her to receive, probably on the ensuing day,
the proposals of <span class="smcap">Tittlebat Titmouse</span>.</p>

<p>The desired opportunity occurred the next day. Titmouse
had slept like a top all night, after smoking in his
bedroom a great many cigars, and drinking several tumblers
of brandy and water. Lady Cecilia, however, had
passed a very uneasy, and almost a sleepless night, and
did not make her appearance at the breakfast-table. Understanding
that her Ladyship was in the drawing-room,
and alone, about noon, Titmouse, who had bestowed during
the interval more than usual pains upon his dress,
gently opened the door, and observing her reclining alone
on the sofa, he closed the door behind him, with a sudden
beating of the heart, and approached her, bowing profoundly.
Poor Lady Cecilia immediately sat up, very pale
and trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-morning, good-morning, Lady Cicely," commenced
Titmouse, with evident agitation, taking a chair
and sitting down in it, plump opposite to her.</p>

<p>"You aren't well this morning, are you, Lady Cicely?"
he continued, observing how pale she looked, and that she
did not seem disposed to speak.</p>

<p>"I am quite well," she replied in a low tone: and then
each was silent.</p>

<p>"It's beginning to look like winter a little, eh, Lady
Cicely?" said he, after an embarrassing pause, looking
through the windows&mdash;and his words diffused an icy coldness
over Lady Cecilia. 'Twas an overcast day; and a
strong wind was stripping the sere and yellow leaves in
great numbers from the lofty trees which were not far
distant, and gave forth a melancholy, rushing, moaning
sound.</p>

<p>"Certainly it is getting rather cheerless," replied Lady
Cecilia, after several moments' pause. Titmouse turned
pale; and twirling his fingers in his hair, fixed upon her
a stupid and most embarrassing look, under which her
eyes fell towards the ground, and remained looking in
that direction.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;hope his Lordship's been saying a good
word for me, Lady Cicely?" he inquired with an absurdly
sheepish air.</p>

<p>"My father mentioned your name to me yesterday,"
she replied, trembling excessively.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, monstrous kind!" said Titmouse, trying
desperately to look at his ease. "<i>Said</i> he'd break
the ice for me." Here ensued another pause. "Everybody
must have a beginning, you know. 'Pon my solemn
honor, Lady Cicely, all he said about me is quite true."
Profoundly as was Lady Cecilia depressed, she looked up
at Titmouse for a moment with evident surprise. "Now,
Lady Cicely, just as between friends, didn't he tell you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
something <i>very</i> particular about me? Didn't he? Eh?"
She made him no answer.</p>

<p>"I dare say, Lady Cicely, though somehow you look sad
enough, you a'n't <i>vexed</i> to see me here? Eh? There's
many and many a woman in London that would&mdash;but
it's no use now. 'Pon my soul, I love you, I do, Lady
Cicely;" she trembled violently, for he was drawing his
chair nearer to her. She felt sick&mdash;sick almost to death;
and a mist came for a moment over her eyes.</p>

<p>"I know it's&mdash;it's a monstrous unpleasant piece of&mdash;I
mean, it's an awkward thing to do; but I hope you love
<i>me</i>, Lady Cicely, eh! a little?" Her head hung down,
and a very scalding tear oozed out and trickled down her
cheek. "Hope you aren't sorry, dear Lady Cicely? <i>I'm</i>
most uncommon proud and happy! Come, Lady Cicely."
He took the thin white hand that was nearest him, and
raised it to his lips. Had his perceptions been only a
trifle keener, he could not have failed to observe a faint
thrill pervade Lady Cecilia as he performed this act of
gallantry, and an expression of features which looked very
much like disgust. He had, however, seen love made on
the stage, frequently; and, as he had seen lovers do there,
he now dropped down on one knee, still holding Lady
Cecilia's hand in his, and pressing it a second time to
his lips.</p>

<p>"If your Ladyship will only make me&mdash;so happy&mdash;as
to be&mdash;my wife&mdash;'pon my life you're welcome to all
I have; and you may consider this place entirely your
own! Do you understand me, dearest Lady Cicely?
Come! 'Pon my life&mdash;I'm quite distracted&mdash;do you
love me, Lady Cicely? Only say the word." A faint&mdash;a
very faint sound issued from her lips&mdash;'twas&mdash;blush
for her, my lady reader&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Yes.</span>" [Oh, poor Lady Cecilia!
Oh, fatal&mdash;fatal falsehood!]</p>

<p>"Then, as true as God's in heaven, dear gal, I love
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
you," said he, with ardor and energy; and rising from
his knee, he sat down beside her upon the sofa&mdash;placed
an arm round her waist; with his other hand grasped
hers&mdash;and&mdash;imprinted a kiss upon the pale cheek which
had been so haughtily withdrawn from the presumptuous
advances of the Marquis de Millefleurs, and from some
half dozen others; several of whom had been men of commanding
pretensions&mdash;elegant in person and manners&mdash;of
great accomplishments&mdash;of intellect&mdash;of considerable
fortune&mdash;of good family; but in her opinion, and that
of the earl her father, not of family good <i>enough</i>, nor
fortune considerable <i>enough</i>, to entitle any of them to an
alliance with her.</p>

<p>"'Pon my life, Lady Cicely, you <i>are</i> a most lovely
gal," quoth Titmouse, with increasing energy&mdash;"and
now you're all my own! Though I <i>am</i> only plain Mr.
Titmouse, and you'll be Lady Cicely still&mdash;I'll make
you a good husband!" and again he pressed her hand
and kissed her cold cheek. But slow and dull as were
the Lady Cecilia's feelings, they were becoming too much
excited to admit of her continuing much longer in the
room.</p>

<p>"I'm sure&mdash;you'll&mdash;excuse&mdash;me, Mr. Titmouse,"
said she, rising, and speaking quickly and faintly. When
she had regained her room, she wept bitterly for upwards
of an hour; and Miss Macspleuchan, well aware of the
cause of it, knew not how to console one who had so
deliberately immolated herself before the hideous little
image of Mammon; who, in degrading herself, had also&mdash;and
Miss Macspleuchan, a true lady, when alone, shed
bitter and scalding tears, and her bosom swelled with
wounded pride and indignation at the thought&mdash;degraded
her whole sex. In due time, however, the <i>Aurora</i>,
a fashionable morning London newspaper, thus
announced to the public, as an <i>auspicious</i> event, the one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
which I have so faithfully, feeling much pain the while,
described to the reader:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is rumored that Mr. Titmouse, who so lately recovered
the very large estates of Yatton, in Yorkshire, and whose appearance
in the fashionable world has created so great a sensation,
and who is already connected, by consanguinity, with the
ancient and noble family of Dreddlington, is about to form a
closer alliance with it, and is now the accepted suitor of the
lovely and accomplished Lady Cecilia Philippa Leopoldina
Plantagenet, sole daughter and heiress of the Right Hon. the
Earl of Dreddlington, and next in succession to the barony of
Drelincourt, the most ancient, we believe, in the kingdom."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>Behold now, thoughtful reader&mdash;for in your eyes it is
anxiously desired that this history may find favor&mdash;the
dreadful&mdash;the desperate reverse in Mr. Aubrey's circumstances.
He has suddenly fallen from a very commanding
position in society: from that of a high-born English
gentleman, possessed of a fine unencumbered income, and
all of luxury and splendor, and of opportunity for gratifying
a disposition of noble munificence, that it can secure&mdash;and
whose qualifications and prospects justified him in
aspiring to the highest senatorial distinction:&mdash;behold
him, I say, with his beloved and helpless family, sunk&mdash;lower
than into straitened circumstances&mdash;beneath even
poverty&mdash;into the palsying atmosphere of <i>debt</i>&mdash;and
debt, too, inextricable and hopeless. Seeing that no one
can be so secure, but that all this, or something of the
like kind, may one day or other happen to him, 'tis
hoped that it will be found neither uninteresting nor
uninstructive to watch carefully and closely the present
condition and <i>conduct</i> of the Aubreys.</p>

<p>Bound hand and foot&mdash;so to speak&mdash;as Mr. Aubrey
felt himself, and entirely at the mercy of Mr. Titmouse
and his solicitors, Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap,
what could he do but submit to almost any terms on
which they chose to insist? It will be recollected that
Mr. Gammon's proposal was,<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> that Mr. Aubrey should
forthwith discharge, without scrutiny, their bill of £3,946,
14s. 6d.; give sufficient security for the payment of the
sum of £10,000 to Mr. Titmouse, within twelve or eighteen
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
months' time, and two promissory notes for the sum
of £5,000 each, payable at some future period, as to
which he had to rely solely on the sincerity and forbearance
of Mr. Gammon, and the ratification of his acts
by Mr. Titmouse. This proposal was duly communicated
by the unfortunate Aubrey to Messrs. Runnington, who
obtained from Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, a fortnight's
time in which to deliberate upon it. Messrs.
Runnington almost immediately advised him to accept
the proposed terms as unquestionably fair, and, under the
circumstances, much more lenient than could have been
expected. This might be so; but yet, how dismaying
and hopeless to <i>him</i> the idea of carrying them into effect!
<i>How, indeed, was it to be done?</i> First of all, how were
Messrs. Runnington's and Mr. Parkinson's bills to be got
rid of&mdash;the former amounting to £1,670, 12s., the latter
to £756? And how were Mr. Aubrey and his family to
<i>live</i> in the mean while, and how, moreover, were to be met
the expenses of his legal education? As was intimated
in a former part of this history, all that Mr. Aubrey had,
on settling in London, was £3,000 stock (equal to £2,640
of money) and £423 in his banker's hands:&mdash;so that all
his cash in hand was £3,063! and if he were to devote
the whole of it to the discharge of the three attorneys'
bills which he owed, he would still leave a gross balance
unpaid of £3,310, 6s. 6d.! And yet for <i>him</i> to talk of
<i>giving security</i> for the payment of £10,000 within eighteen
months, and his own notes of hand for £10,000
more! It was really almost maddening to sit down and
contemplate all this. But he must not fold his arms in
impotence and despair&mdash;he must look his difficulties
straight in the face, and do the best that was in his
power. He resolved to devote every farthing he had,
except £200, to the liquidation of Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap's account, and (in smaller proportion) of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
those also of Messrs. Runnington and Mr. Parkinson; if
necessary he resolved, though his heart thrilled with anguish
at the thought, to sell his books, and the remnant
of old family plate that he had preserved. Then he would
strain every nerve to contribute towards the support of
himself and of his family&mdash;poor oppressed soul!&mdash;by
his literary exertions, in every moment that he could
spare from his legal studies; and practise the severest
economy that was consistent with health, and the preservation
of a respectable exterior. He resolved also, though
with a shudder, to commit himself to Gammon and Titmouse's
mercy, by handing to them (though a fearful
farce it seemed) his two notes of hand for £10,000&mdash;<i>payable
on demand</i>&mdash;for such Gammon intimated was
usual in such a case, and would be required in the present
one. But whither was he to look for security for
the payment of £10,000 within eighteen months' time?
This was a matter which indeed staggered him, and almost
prostrated his energies whenever he directed them
to the subject; it occasioned him inexpressible agitation
and anguish. Individuals there were, he believed&mdash;he
knew&mdash;who would cheerfully enter into the desired security
on his behalf; but what a mockery! For them
to be asked to secure <i>his</i> payment of the sum, at the
time mentioned, was, in effect, palpably asking them to
pay the money for him; and in that light they could
not but view such an application. The reader will easily
understand the potency of such considerations upon so
sensitive and high-minded a person as Mr. Aubrey. While
revolving these distracting and harassing topics in his
mind, the name of Lord De la Zouch always presented
itself to him. Had he not solemnly&mdash;repeatedly&mdash;<i>pledged</i>
himself to communicate with that kind, and
wealthy, and generous nobleman, in such an emergency
as the present? His Lordship's income was at least
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
eighty or a hundred thousand pounds a-year; his habits
were simple and unostentatious, though he was of a truly
munificent disposition; and he had not a large and expensive
family&mdash;his only child being Mr. Delamere.
He had ever professed, and, as far as he had hitherto
had an opportunity, proved himself to be a devoted, a
most affectionate friend to Mr. Aubrey:&mdash;did not Providence,
then, seem to point him out distinctly as one who
should be applied to, to rescue from destruction a fallen
friend? And why should Aubrey conjure up an array of
imaginary obstacles, arising out of a diseased delicacy?
And whom were such scruples reducing to destitution
along with him!&mdash;his wife, his children, his devoted
and noble-minded sister! But, alas! the thought of
sweet Kate suggested another source of exquisite pain
and embarrassment to Aubrey, who well knew the ardent
and inextinguishable passion for her entertained by
young Delamere. 'Twas true that, to pacify his father,
and also not to grieve or harass Miss Aubrey by the constant
attentions with which he would have otherwise followed
her, he had consented to devote himself with great
assiduity and ardor to his last year's studies at Oxford;
yet was he by no means an infrequent visitor at Vivian
Street, resolutely regardless of the earnest entreaties of
Miss Aubrey, and even of her brother. Not that there
was ever anything indelicate or obtrusive in his attentions;&mdash;how
could it be? Alas! Kate really loved him,
and it required no very great acuteness in Delamere to
discover it. He was as fine, handsome a young fellow
as you could see anywhere; frank, high-spirited, accomplished,
with an exceedingly elegant deportment, and
simple, winning manners&mdash;and could she but be touched
with a lively sense of the noble disinterestedness of his
attachment to her! I declare that Kate wrote him several
letters, in <i>bonâ fide</i> dissuasion of his addresses, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
which wore such a genuine and determined air of repulsion,
as would have staggered most men; but young
Delamere cared not one straw for any of them: let Kate
vary her tone as she pleased, he told her simply that he
had sent them to his mother, who said they were very
good letters indeed; so he would make a point of reading
all she would send him, and so forth. When Kate,
with too solemn an emphasis to be mistaken or encountered
with raillery, assured him that nothing upon earth
should prevail upon her to quit her present station in her
brother's family, at all events until he had completely
surmounted all his troubles, Delamere, with looks of fond
admiration, would reply that it signified nothing, as he
was prepared to wait her pleasure, and submit to any
caprice or unkindness in which her heart would allow
her to indulge. I must own that poor Kate was, on
more than one occasion of his exhibiting traits of delicate
generosity towards her brother, so moved and melted towards
her lover, that she could&mdash;shall I say it?&mdash;have
sunk into his arms in silent and passionate acquiescence;
for her heart had, indeed, long been really his.&mdash;But
whither am I wandering?&mdash;To return, then&mdash;I say,
that when Mr. Aubrey adverted for a moment to this
state of things, was it not calculated a thousand-fold to
enhance the difficulty of his applying <i>to the father of Delamere</i>?
So indeed it was; and, torn with conflicting emotions
and considerations of this kind, nearly the whole of
the fortnight granted to him for deliberation had elapsed,
before he could make up his mind to apply to Lord De la
Zouch. At length, however, with a sort of calm desperation,
he determined to do so; and when he had deposited
in the Post-Office his letter&mdash;one in every line of which
the noble and generous person to whom it was addressed
might easily detect the writhings of its writer's wounded
spirit&mdash;the quiverings of a broken heart&mdash;he looked
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
indeed a melancholy object. The instant that, by dropping
his letter into the box, he had irrecoverably parted
with all control over it, and to Lord De la Zouch it must
go, Aubrey felt as if he would have given the world to
recall it. Never had he heaved so many profound sighs,
and felt so utterly miserable and destitute, as during his
walk homeward that afternoon. Those dear beings did
not know of the step he had intended to take; nor did
he tell them that he had taken it. When he saw his
sister he felt sick at heart; and during the whole of the
evening was so oppressed and subdued, that the faint
anxious raillery of lovely Mrs. Aubrey and Kate, and
the unconscious sportiveness of his children, served only
to deepen the gloom which was around his spirit!&mdash;He
had requested Lord De la Zouch to address his answer to
him at the Temple; and sure enough, by return of post,
Mr. Aubrey found lying on his desk, on reaching the Temple
three or four mornings afterwards, a letter addressed,
"Charles Aubrey, Esq., at &mdash;&mdash; Weasel's, Esq., No. 3,
Pomegranate Court, Temple, London;" and franked,
"<span class="smcap">De la Zouch</span>."</p>

<p>"I shall return presently," said Mr. Aubrey to the clerk,
with as much calmness as he could assume, having put
the letter into his pocket, resolving to go into the Temple
gardens and there read it, where any emotion which it
might excite, would be unobserved. Having at length
seated himself on a bench, under one of the old trees near
the river, with a somewhat tremulous hand he took out,
and opened the letter, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div align="right"> "<i>Fotheringham Castle, 18th July 18&mdash;.</i></div>

"<span class="smcap">My very dear Aubrey</span>,

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If you really value my friendship, never pain my feelings
again by expressions, such as are contained in your letter, of
distrust as to the issue of <i>any</i> application of yours to me. Has
anything that has ever hitherto passed between us, justified
them? For Heaven's sake, tell your solicitors not to lose a
moment in procuring the necessary instruments, and forwarding
them to me through Messrs. Framlingham, <i>my</i> solicitors.
I will execute immediately all that are sent, and return them
by the next post, or mail. If you will but at once set about
this in a business-like way, I will forgive and forget all the
absurd and <i>unkind</i> scruples with which your letter abounds.
Since you would probably make a mighty stir about it, I shall
not at present dwell upon the <i>inexpressible pleasure</i> it would
give me to be allowed to emancipate you at once from the vulgar
and grasping wretches who are now harassing you, my very
dear Aubrey, and to constitute myself your creditor instead of
them. But on further consideration, I suppose you would distress
yourself on the ground of <i>my restricted</i> means rendering it
so much more difficult for me, than for them, to give you time
for the payment of your debt!! Or will you <small>PLAY THE MAN</small>,
and act at once in the way in which, I assure you, upon my
honor, I would act by you, on a similar solicitation, were our
situations reversed? By the way, I intend to insist on being
your <i>sole surety</i>; unless, indeed, your creditors doubt my solvency,
in which case I hope we shall be able, among our common
friends, to find a sufficient co-surety!&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now, dear Aubrey, how get you on with law? Does
she smile, or scowl upon you? I wonder why you did not go
to the fountain-head, and become at once a pupil to your friend,
the Attorney-General. Who is the gentleman whom you are
reading with? He certainly has rather a curious name! Well,
my dear Aubrey, may Heaven in its own good time crown your
virtuous efforts&mdash;your unconquerable resolution&mdash;with success!
Won't it be odd if, when I am dead and gone, and my
son is occupying my present place on the benches of the House
of Lords, you should be sitting on the woolsack? More unlikely
things than this have come to pass: look at&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How are dear Mrs. Aubrey and Miss Aubrey, and your
darling little ones? Though we are going in a fortnight's
time to fill this old place, (the &mdash;&mdash;s, the &mdash;&mdash;s, and the &mdash;&mdash;s,
and others, are coming,) we shall be, till then, quite deserted,
and so, after they are gone. Would that we could insist on
all of you taking up your abode with us! Have you seen
Geoffrey lately? He tells me that he is working very hard
indeed at Oxford; and so says his tutor. But I have my
doubts; for it is more than ever I did. Pray write me by

<p>No language of mine can do justice to the feelings with
which Mr. Aubrey, after many pauses, occasioned by absolutely
irrepressible emotion, perused the foregoing letter.
Its generosity was infinitely enhanced by its delicacy; and
both were exquisitely appreciated by a man of his susceptibility,
and in his circumstances. His eyes&mdash;his heart,
overflowed with unutterable gratitude towards the Almighty,
and the noble instrument of his mercy. He
could have flown on the wings of the wind to the dear
beings in Vivian Street, with joyous face and light elastic
step, to make them participators in his joy. He rose and
walked to and fro by the river side with most exhilarated
spirits. The sky was cloudless: the sun shone brilliantly;
and innumerable brisk and busy craft were moving to and
fro upon the swelling bosom of the magnificent Thames.
Gladness was in his soul. The light without was typical
of that within. Several times he was on the point of
starting off to Vivian Street; but, on consideration, he
resolved to go to Messrs. Runnington, and put them into
instant communication with Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
Snap; and matters having been set in train for the speediest
possible settlement, Mr. Aubrey returned to chambers;
but quitted them an hour earlier than usual, to
brighten the countenances of those he loved, by the joyous
intelligence he bore. But he found that they also
had cheering news to communicate; so that this was indeed
a memorable day to them.</p>

<p>Lady Stratton, not only a relative, but a devoted bosom
friend of the late Mrs. Aubrey, had, it may easily be believed,
never ceased to take a lively interest in the fortunes
of the unhappy Aubreys. She was now far advanced in
years, and childless; and though she enjoyed an ample
life income, derived from the liberality of her husband,
Sir Beryl Stratton, Baronet, who had died some twenty
or thirty years before; yet, seeing no necessity for saving
money, she had followed the noble example of her deceased
friend Mrs. Aubrey, and bestowed annually all her
surplus income in the most liberal and systematic charity.
Many years before, however, she had resolved upon
making a provision for Miss Aubrey, whom she loved as
if she had been her mother; and the expedient she had
resorted to (quite unknown to the Aubreys) was to insure
her life for the sum of £15,000, the whole of which sum
she had intended to bequeath to Miss Aubrey. The premiums
on so large an insurance, were heavy annual drains
upon her purse; and, together with her long-continued
charities, and the expenditure necessary to support her
station, left her but stinted means for contributing to the
relief of the ruined Aubreys. With some difficulty, however,
the old lady, in one way or another, principally by
effecting a loan from the insurance company upon her policy,
had contrived to raise a sum of £2,000; and Miss
Aubrey had that morning received a letter from her, full
of tenderness, begging her to present the sum in question
(for which Lady Stratton had lodged a credit with her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
bankers in London) to her brother Mr. Aubrey, to dispose
of as he pleased&mdash;trusting that it might be effectual in relieving
him from the difficulties which were more immediately
pressing upon him. Never had they spent so happy
an evening together since they had quitted Yatton. In
the excitement of the hour, even Aubrey felt for a while
as if they now saw their way through all their embarrassments
and dangers. Can the reader imagine what must
have been the feelings of Miss Aubrey when she first
heard of, and afterwards reflected upon, the princely munificence
of Lord De la Zouch? If he can, it is well&mdash;it
is more than I am equal to describing. Her agitation
kept her awake more than half the night; and when she
appeared at breakfast, her brother's quick eye detected in
her countenance the traces of a severe conflict of feelings.
With him also much of the excitement occasioned by the
two occurrences above mentioned, had disappeared by the
time that he took his seat in his little study at his usual
early hour. First of all, he felt very uneasy in receiving
so large a sum from Lady Stratton, whom he knew to be
by no means rich&mdash;at all events, not rich enough to part
with so considerable an amount without inconvenience;
and he resolved not to accept of her proffered kindness,
unless she would allow him to transmit to her his bond
for the repayment, together with interest on what he
might borrow. Surely this was an unnecessary step; yet
where is the man who, on all occasions, acts precisely as
a calm and reflecting observer of his conduct, <i>long afterwards</i>,
could have wished him to act? One must make
allowance for the feelings which prompted him&mdash;those
of a highly honorable and independent and over-sensitive
man, who felt himself oppressed already by the weight of
pecuniary obligation which he had incurred, and sought
for the semblance of relief to his feelings by receiving
that as a <i>loan</i>, only, which had been nobly proffered as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
a gift; and thus, as it were, in point of fact destroying
all the grace and courtesy of the benefaction; but it is
useless discussing the matter. I regret that Mr. Aubrey
should have allowed himself to be influenced by such considerations;
but so it was&mdash;and worthy Lady Stratton
was informed by him in a letter certainly abounding in
expressions of heartfelt gratitude and affection, that he
had availed himself of her generous assistance, but only
on the terms of his being allowed to deposit his bond for
the repayment of it, with interest, with her solicitors; expressing
his hope that ere long he should be enabled to fulfil
every engagement into which he might have entered.</p>

<p>This seasonable assistance enabled him to make the
following arrangement for liquidating the sums due on
account of his sickening attorney's bills:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap's bill was &nbsp;</td><td align='right'>£3,946 14 6</td></tr>

<tr><td align='right'></td><td align='right'>£6,373 &nbsp; 6 6</td></tr>

<p>These were his liabilities. Then his assets were:&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td align='left'>Money at his banker's</td><td align='right'>423</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>And there remained &nbsp;</td><td align='right'>£1,310 6 6</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>As soon as he had made the foregoing statement on a
slip of paper early in the morning in his study, (as already
intimated,) he averted his eye from it, for a moment, with
a sort of cold shudder. Were he to devote every farthing
of assets that he had, he still could not come within
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
£1,310 odd of his mere attorney's bills. What was he
to do? The result of a long and anxious morning's calculation
and scheming was to appropriate £4,000 of his
assets thus&mdash;(if he could prevail upon his creditors to
be for the present content with it:)&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td align='right'></td><td align='right'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'></td><td align='right'>£4,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If this arrangement could be effected, then he would
be able to reserve in his own hands £1,063, and retain
liabilities as under:&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<p>Heavy was his heart at beholding this result of even
the most favorable mode of putting his case: but he
placed the memoranda in his pocket-book, and repaired
to his dressing-room; and having completed his toilet,
appeared at breakfast with as cheerful a countenance as
he could assume. Each of the three assembled, perceived,
however, that the others were <i>striving</i> to look gay and
happy. Suffice it to say, that within a week's time,
Messrs. Runnington received the necessary security from
Lord De la Zouch, who had thereby bound himself in the
penal sum of £20,000 that Mr. Aubrey should, on or
before the 24th day of January 18&mdash;, (that is, in eighteen
months' time from the date of the bond,) pay the principal
sum of £10,000, with interest at 5 per cent; and this
instrument, together with Mr. Aubrey's two promissory-notes
for £5,000 each, and also cash to the amount of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
£2,500 in part payment of their bill, having been delivered
to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap&mdash;who, after a great
deal of reluctance on the part of Mr. Quirk, finally consented
to allow the balance of £1,446, 14s. 6d. to stand
over&mdash;they gave him, first, a receipt for so much on
account of their own bill; and secondly, an instrument
by which Tittlebat Titmouse, for the considerations therein
expressed, did "<i>remise, release, and forever quit claim</i>,"
unto Charles Aubrey, his heirs, executors, and administrators,
all other demands whatsoever, [<i>i. e.</i> other than
the said sum of £20,000.] By this arrangement Mr.
Aubrey was absolutely exonerated from the sum of
£40,000, in which he stood indubitably indebted to Mr.
Titmouse; and so far he had just cause for congratulation.
But was not his situation still one calculated to
depress and alarm him more and more every time that
he contemplated it? Where was he to find the sum
requisite to release Lord De la Zouch from any part of
his enormous liability? For with such a surety in their
power as that great and opulent peer, was it likely that
Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, would be otherwise
than peremptory and inflexible when the day of payment
arrived? And if so, with what feelings must Mr. Aubrey
see his noble and generous friend called upon to pay down
nearly £11,000 for him? And was he not liable at any
moment upon his own two notes for £5,000 each? And
were they not likely to insist speedily on the discharge of
their own serious balance of £1,446 odd? What more
probable, than that persons such as they and their client
were represented to be, would, as soon as they decently
could, proceed to extremities with him, in the confidence
that the sight and the sound of his agonies would call in
powerful and affluent friends to his assistance?</p>

<p>Still pressed, as indeed he was, his spirit had by no means
lost its elasticity, supported as he was by a powerful, an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
unconquerable <small>WILL</small>&mdash;and also by a devout reliance upon
the protection of Providence. Though law is indeed an
exhausting and absorbing study, and it was pursued by
Mr. Aubrey with unflagging energy, yet he found time
(those who choose may find time enough for everything)
to contribute sensibly to the support of himself and his
family by literary labors, expended principally upon compositions
of an historical and political character, and
which were forwarded from time to time to the distinguished
Review which has been already mentioned. To
produce, as he produced, articles of this description&mdash;of
considerable length and frequency&mdash;requiring ready, extensive,
and accurate knowledge, and careful composition;
original and vigorous in their conception and their
execution, and by their intrinsic merit arresting, immediately
on their appearance, the attention of the public; I
say, to do such things&mdash;and only in those precious intervals
which ought to have been given to the relaxation
of his strained mental and physical powers&mdash;and under
the pressure, too, of such overpowering anxieties as were
his&mdash;argued surely the possession of superior energies&mdash;of
an indomitable resolution. All this while, moreover,
he contrived to preserve an unruffled <i>temper</i>&mdash;which,
with a man of such sensibilities as his, afforded indeed
a signal instance of self-control; and in short, on all
these grounds, Mr. Aubrey appears really entitled to our
deepest sympathy and respect. I spoke of his anxieties.
Suppose, thought he, health should fail him, what was to
become of him, and of those absolutely dependent upon
him? Suppose illness should invade the dear members
of his family, what was in prospect but destitution&mdash;or
surrendering them up&mdash;bitter and heart-breaking contingency!&mdash;to
the precarious <i>charity</i> of others. What
would avail all his exhausting labors in the acquisition of
professional knowledge, while his liberty was entirely at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
the command of Mr. Titmouse, and Messrs. Quirk, Gammon,
and Snap, who might, at any moment, actuated by
mercenary motives, or impelled by caprice, blight all his
prospects, and incarcerate him in a prison! Yet, under
this burden&mdash;to adopt the language of Sir Henry Spelman
on an analogous occasion, "<i>non ingentem solum, sed
perpetuis humeris sustinendum</i>"&mdash;Mr. Aubrey stood firmly.
He felt that he was called upon to sustain it; a
blessed spirit ever, as it were, beside him, whispering the
consolatory assurance, that all this was ordered and designed
by the Supreme Disposer of events, as a <i>trial</i> of
his constancy, and of his faith, and that the <i>issue</i> was
with <span class="smcap">Him</span>. It is mercifully ordained, that "hope springs
eternal in the human breast," and that, too, in every
turn and variety of mortal misery. It was so with Aubrey.
So long as he felt his health unimpaired, and his
mental energies in full vigor, he looked on these blessings
as a sort of guarantee from Heaven that he should be
able to carry on a successful, though it might be a long
and wearisome, struggle with adverse circumstances. Still
it cost him a very painful effort to assume and preserve
that exterior of tranquillity, which should calm and assure
the beloved beings associated with him in this hour
of peril and suffering; and oftener than they chose to
let him know of it, did the keen eye of a wife's, and sister's
love, detect the gloom and oppression which darkened
his countenance, and saddened his manner. Theirs
was, notwithstanding all I have said, a happy little home.
He was generally punctual to his dinner-hour, to a moment;
knowing the thousand fears on his account which
would otherwise assail the fond beings who were counting
the minutes till his arrival. When they had once thus
met, they seldom separated till bed-time. Sometimes
Miss Aubrey would sit down to her piano, and accompany
herself in some song or air, which equally, whether merry
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
or mournful, revived innumerable touching and tender
recollections of former days; and she often ceased, tremulously
and in tears, in which she was not unfrequently
joined by both of those who had been listening to her.
Then he would betake himself to his labors for the rest
of the evening (not quitting the room), they either assisting
him&mdash;fair and eager amanuenses! or themselves
reading, or engaged at needlework. Oh! it was ecstasy,
too, to that poor oppressed father to enter into the
wild sports and gambols of his light-hearted little ones,
Charles and Agnes, who always made their appearance
for about a couple of hours after dinner; to tell them
"stories;" to listen to theirs; to show them pictures;
to hear Charles read; and to join heartily in their frolics,
even rolling about on the floor with them! But when he
paused for a moment, and his wife and Kate succeeded
him as their playmates, for a short interval; when his
eye followed their movements&mdash;what sudden and sharp
pangs would pass through his heart, as he thought of the
future, and what was to become of them!&mdash;And when
their maid arrived at the appointed hour, causing all
sport instantly to cease, and longing looks to be directed
to papa and mamma, saying as plainly as could be said,
"only a <i>few</i> minutes more," how fondly would he embrace
them! and when he felt their tiny arms clasping
his neck and caressing him, and their kisses "all over"
his face, feelings were excited within him, which were too
deep for utterance&mdash;which defy description. 'Tis said&mdash;I
know not with what truth&mdash;of Robespierre, as an
instance of his fearful refinement in cruelty, that a person
of distinction who had become obnoxious to him he formally
condemned to death, but allowed to remain in the
torturing, the excruciating presence of his lovely family;
he and they aware, all the while, that his doom was <i>irrevocable</i>,
inevitable; and he momentarily liable to the summons
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
to the guillotine, and which in fact&mdash;oh, horror!&mdash;came
at length, when they were all seated together,
one day, at the breakfast-table! Oh, the feelings with
which that unfortunate person must have daily regarded
the countenances of those around him! How applicable
to his condition the heart-breaking strains of Medea&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The above passage was one which very frequently, on
the occasions I have alluded to, occurred to the mind of
Mr. Aubrey; for he felt himself indeed every moment at
the mercy of those to whom he owed such a fearful
amount of money, and for which he was liable, at any
moment selected by malice or rapacity, to be plucked
from his little home, and cast into prison!</p>

<p>Oh, happy ye, now reading these pages, <i>unto whom the
lines are fallen in pleasant places! yea, who have a goodly
heritage</i>; who live, as it were, in a <i>land flowing with milk
and honey</i>; with whom life glides away like a tranquil
and pleasant dream; who are not sternly bidden <i>to eat
your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling
and with carefulness</i>,<a name="FNanchor_30_34" id="FNanchor_30_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_34" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> nor <i>in vain to rise up early</i>, to
<i>sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows</i>; who have, indeed,
<i>no thought for the morrow</i>;&mdash;oh, ye who have leisure and
ample means to pursue the objects of an honorable ambition,
undisturbed by daily fears for daily bread&mdash;by
terror, lest implacable creditors should at length frustrate
all your efforts, drive you from your position in society,
and precipitate you and yours into ruin;&mdash;I say, oh ye!
do I appeal to you in vain? Do you turn from this painful
portion of my narrative with indifference, or contempt,
or wearisomeness? If the mere <i>description</i>, brief though
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
it may be, of the sufferings of the Aubreys be trying and
unpleasing to you, what must have been to them the actual
<i>endurance</i>? Poor Aubrey! As he walked along the
crowded thoroughfares, morning and evening, between
the Temple and Vivian Street, what a disheartening consciousness
he felt of his personal insignificance! Which
of the passengers, patrician or plebeian, who met or passed
him, cared&mdash;if personally unknown to him&mdash;one straw
for him, or <i>would</i> have cared a straw for him, had they
even known the load of misery and misfortune under
which he staggered past them? Every time that he thus
passed between the scene of his absorbing labors at the
Temple, and that green spot&mdash;his house in Vivian Street&mdash;in
the world's wide desert, where only his heart was
refreshed by the never-failing spring of domestic love and
tenderness, he felt, as it were, but a prisoner out upon parole!
It is easy to understand that, when a man walks
along the streets of London, depressed in spirit, and
alarmed by the consciousness of increasing pecuniary embarrassment,
his temper is likely to become irritable, his
deportment forbidding, his spirit stern and soured, particularly
against those who appeal to his charity; which
then, indeed, he might be pardoned for feeling, and bitterly&mdash;<i>to
begin at home</i>. It was not so, however, with
Aubrey, whose constant feeling was&mdash;<i>Haud ignarus mali,
miseris succurrere disco</i>; and though it may appear a small
thing to mention, I feel gratification in recording of him,
that, desperate as were his circumstances, infinitely enhanced
to him as was the value of money, he went seldom
unprovided with the means of relieving the humbler applicants
for charity whom he passed in the streets&mdash;of
dropping some small token of his love and pity into the
trembling and feeble hand of <i>want</i>&mdash;of those whose necessities
he felt to be greater even than his own. Never,
indeed, did the timid eye of the most tattered, starved,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
and emaciated object suffered to crawl along the streets,
catch that of Mr. Aubrey, without making his heart acknowledge
the secret bond of misery which bound them
together&mdash;that he beheld a brother in bondage, and on
whom he cheerfully bestowed the humble pittance which
he believed that Providence had yet left at his disposal!&mdash;Prosperity
and adversity have equally the effect, upon
an inferior mind and heart, of generating <i>selfishness</i>. The
one encourages, the other forces it. Misery is apt to
think its own sufferings greater than those of any one
else&mdash;and naturally. The eye, as it were, is filled with
the object&mdash;that is to say, of distress and danger&mdash;which
is nearest&mdash;which is in such fearful contiguity, obscuring
from view all remoter objects, at once scaring
away presence of mind, and centring its hopes and fears
upon <i>self</i>. Not so, however, is it when a noble nature is
the sufferer&mdash;and more especially when that nature is
strengthened and brightened by the support and consolation
derived from philosophy&mdash;and, above all, religion.
To many a strong spirit, destitute of such assistance, alas!
how often, under similar circumstances, have come&mdash;ghastly
visitants!&mdash;<i>Despair</i> and <i>Madness</i>, with their hideous
attendant <span class="smcap">Suicide</span>, to do their bidding?</p>

<p>To Mr. Aubrey the Sabbath was indeed not only a day
for performing the public services of religion, but also a
day of real rest from the labors of life. It was not one,
to him, of puritanical gloom or excitement, but of sincere,
cheerful, fervent, enlightened devotion. It would have
been to the reader, I think, not an uninteresting sight to
behold this unfortunate and harassed family at church.
They took almost the only pew which was vacant in the
gallery&mdash;in a church not far distant from Vivian Street&mdash;a
pew just holding themselves and little Charles; who,
since their arrival in town, had begun to accompany them
to the morning service. There was something in their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
appearance&mdash;punctual as they were in both the morning
and evening&mdash;which could hardly fail to have interested
any one who observed them. There were two very elegant
and lovely women, dressed in simple half-mourning:
a man of calm, gentlemanly manners, and an intellectual
countenance, but overshadowed with deep seriousness, if
not melancholy&mdash;as, indeed, was the case with the whole
of the little group, except the beautiful child, Charles.
If their mere appearance was thus calculated to interest
those around, who beheld them so punctual in their
attendance, how much would that interest have been
increased, had the beholder known their singular and
melancholy history? Here were individuals, whose condition
was testing the reality of the consolations of religion,
exhibiting humility, resignation, faith, a deep delight
in attending the house of <span class="smcap">Him</span> who had permitted such
dreadful disasters to befall them, and whose will it yet
seemed to be that they should pass through deeper sufferings
than they had yet experienced. His temple seemed,
indeed, to them, a refuge and shelter from the storm. To
Mr. Aubrey every portion of the church service was precious,
for its purity, its simplicity, its solemnity, its fervor,
its truly scriptural character, its adaptation to every imaginable
condition of feeling and of circumstance, indeed,
"to all sorts and conditions of men." A little incident
fraught with much interest, occurred to them shortly after
they commenced their attendance at the church. An
occasional sermon was preached one evening by a stranger,
from the words "<i>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in
him</i>," on behalf of a neighboring dispensary. Mr. Aubrey
was soon struck by the unusual strength and beauty of
the sermon, in point of composition&mdash;the fervor and simplicity
of the preacher. Its language was at once chaste
and forcible; its reasoning clear and cogent; its illustration
apt and vivid; its pathos genuine. As he went on,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
Mr. Aubrey became more and more convinced that he had
seen or heard the preacher before; and on inquiring, afterwards,
his name, his impressions proved to be correct;&mdash;the
clergyman had been at Oxford, at the very same
college with him, and this was the first time that they
had since come within sight of each other. Mr. Aubrey
very soon afterwards had an opportunity of introducing
himself to the clergyman, and was recognized, and they
renewed their early friendship. Mr. Neville&mdash;for that
was his name&mdash;poor soul, had nothing upon earth to
support himself with, but an afternoon lectureship in one
of the city churches, from which he derived about £75 a-year;
and on this sum alone he had contrived, for the
last four or five years, to support both himself and his
wife&mdash;a very amiable and fond woman. Fortunately,
they had no children; but they had seen much affliction,
each of them being in but precarious health, and a sad
proportion of his little income was, consequently, devoted
to doctors' bills. He was an admirable scholar; a man
of very powerful understanding, and deeply read in metaphysics
and divinity. Yet this wretched pittance was all
he could procure for his support; and pinching work for
them, poor souls, it was indeed, to "make ends meet."
They lived in very small but creditable lodgings; and
amid all their privations, and with all the gloom of the
future before them, they were as cheerful a little couple
as the world ever saw. They dearly loved, and would
have sacrificed everything for each other; and so long as
they could but keep their chins above water, and he realize
the stern and noble feeling, "pauper, <i>sed in meo ære</i>,"
they cared not for their exclusion from most of the comforts
and all the elegancies of life. They were, both of
them, entirely resigned to the will of Heaven as to their
position&mdash;nay, in all things. She generally accompanied
him whithersoever he went; but on the occasion to which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
I have been alluding, the good little creature was lying at
home in bed, enduring great suffering; and the thought
of it made the preacher's heart very heavy, and his voice
to falter a little, several times during his sermon. He
was perfectly delighted when Mr. Aubrey introduced himself;
and when the latter had heard all his friend's little
history&mdash;who had indeed a child-like simplicity and
frankness, and told Mr. Aubrey everything he knew about
himself&mdash;Mr. Aubrey wrung his hand with great emotion,
almost, indeed, too great for expression. It seemed
that a bishop, before whom poor Neville had accidentally
preached seven years before, had sent for him, and expressed
such a very high opinion of his sermon, as led him
reasonably to look for some little preferment at his Lordship's
hands; but in vain. Poor Neville had no powerful
friends, and the bishop was overwhelmed with applicants
for everything he had to give away; so it is not much to
be wondered at, that, in time, he totally lost sight of Mr.
Neville, and of the hopes which had blossomed, but to be
blighted. What touched Mr. Aubrey to the soul, was the
unaffected cheerfulness with which poor Mr. Neville&mdash;now
in his fortieth year&mdash;reconciled himself to his unpromising
circumstances; the calmness with which he
witnessed the door of preferment evidently <i>shut upon him
forever</i>. Mr. Aubrey obtained from him his address; and
resolved that, though, for reasons long ago explained, he
had withdrawn from almost every one of his former friends
and associates, yet with this poor, this neglected, but
happy clergyman, he would endeavor to renew and cement
firmly their early-formed but long-suspended friendship.
And when, on his return to Vivian Street, (whither
Mrs. and Miss Aubrey had proceeded alone, at his request,
while he walked on with Mr. Neville,) he told them the
little history which I have above indicated to the reader,
how the hearts of all of them went forth towards one who
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
was in many respects a fellow-sufferer with themselves,
and, <i>practising what he preached</i>, was really a pattern of
resignation to the will of God; of humble but hearty
faith in His mercy and loving-kindness!</p>

<p>Mr. Aubrey was not long in paying his promised visit
to Mr. Neville, accompanied by Mrs. Aubrey. 'Twas a
long and not very agreeable walk for them towards St.
George's in the East; and on reaching a small row of
neat houses, only one story high, and being shown into
Mr. Neville's very little sitting-room, they found Mrs.
Neville lying on a little rickety sofa near the fire, looking
very ill, and Mr. Neville sitting before her, with a number
of books on the table, and pen, ink, and paper, with
which he was occupied preparing his next Sunday's sermon;
but there was also a slip of paper on the table of a
different description, and which had occasioned both of
them great distress; viz. a rather peremptory note from
their medical man, touching the payment of his "trifling
account" of £14 odd. Where poor Neville was to obtain
such a sum, neither he nor his wife knew: they had
already almost deprived themselves of necessary food and
clothing to enable them to appease another urgent creditor;
and this new and sudden demand of an old claim,
had indeed grievously disquieted them. They said nothing
about it to Mr. and Mrs. Aubrey, who soon made
themselves at home, and by their unaffected simplicity
and cordiality of manner, relieved their humble hosts
from all anxiety. They partook of tea, in a sufficiently
homely and frugal style; and before they rose to go they
exacted a promise, that, as soon as Mrs. Neville should
have recovered, they would both come and spend a long
day in Vivian Street. They soon became very intimate;
and, Mrs. Neville's health at length being such as to preclude
her from attending at all to her needle, the reader
will possibly think none the less of Mrs. Aubrey and Kate,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
when he hears that they insisted on taking that task
upon themselves, (a matter in which they were becoming
somewhat expert,) and many and many an hour did
these two charming women spend, both in Vivian Street
and at Mrs. Neville's, in relieving her from her labors&mdash;particularly
in preparing her slight stock of winter clothing.
And now that I am on this point, I may as well
mention another not less amiable trait in Kate; that,
hearing of a girl's school about to be founded in connection
with the church which they attended, and in support
of which several ladies had undertaken to prepare various
little matters, such as embroidery, lace, pictures, and
articles of fancy and ornament, Kate also set to work
with her pencil and brushes. She was a very tasteful
draughtswoman, and produced four or five such delicate
and beautiful sketches, in water color, of scenes in and
about Yatton, as made her a very distinguished contributor
to the undertaking; each of her sketches producing
upwards of two guineas. She also drew a remarkably
spirited crayon sketch of the pretty little head of Charles&mdash;who
accompanied her to the place where her contributions
were deposited, and delivered it in with his own
hand.&mdash;Thus, in short, were this sweet and amiable
family rapidly reconciling themselves to their altered circumstances&mdash;taking
real pleasure in the new scenes
which surrounded them, and the novel duties devolving
upon them; and as their feelings became calmer, they
felt how true it is that happiness in this world depends
not upon mere external circumstances, but upon <small>THE MIND</small>&mdash;which,
contented and well regulated, can turn everything
around it into a source of enjoyment and thankfulness&mdash;making
indeed <i>the wilderness to bloom and blossom
as the rose</i>.</p>

<p>They kept up&mdash;especially Kate&mdash;a constant correspondence
with good old Dr. Tatham; who, judging from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
the frequency and the length of his letters, which were written
with a truly old-fashioned distinctness and uniformity
of character, must have found infinite pleasure in his task.
So also was it with Kate, who, if she had even been writing
to her lover&mdash;nay, between ourselves, what would
Mr. Delamere have given to have had addressed to himself
one of the long letters, crossed down to the very postscript,
full of sparkling delicacy, good nature, and good
sense, which so often found their way to the "Rev. Dr.
Tatham, Vicarage, Yatton, Yorkshire!" They were
thus apprised of everything of moment that transpired at
Yatton, to which their feelings clung with unalienable
affection. Dr. Tatham's letters had indeed almost always
a painful degree of interest attached to them. From his
frequent mention of Mr. Gammon's name&mdash;and almost
equally <i>favorable</i> as frequent&mdash;it appeared that he possessed
a vast ascendency over Mr. Titmouse, and was,
whenever he was at Yatton, in a manner, its moving
spirit. The doctor represented Titmouse as a truly
wretched creature, with no more sense of religion than
a monkey; equally silly, selfish, and vulgar&mdash;unfeeling
and tyrannical wherever he had an opportunity of exhibiting
his real character.</p>

<p>It exquisitely pained them, moreover, to find pretty distinct
indications of a sterner and stricter rule being apparent
at Yatton, than had ever been known there before,
so far as the tenants and villagers were concerned. Rents
were now required to be paid with the utmost punctuality;
many of them were raised, and harsher terms introduced
into their leases and agreements. In Mr. Aubrey's
time a distress or an action for rent was a thing literally
unheard of in any part of the estate; but nearly a dozen
had occurred since the accession of Mr. Titmouse. If
this had been at the instance of the ruling spirit, Mr.
Gammon personally had certainly got none of the odium
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
of the proceeding; every letter announcing a resort to
hostile measures expressly purporting to be authorized
by Mr. Titmouse himself; Mr. Gammon on most of such
occasions, putting in a faint word or two in favor of the
tenant, but ineffectually.  The legal proceedings were
always conducted in the name of "Bloodsuck and Son,"
whose town agents were, "Quirk, Gammon, and Snap;"
but <i>their</i> names never came under the eye of the defendants!
No longer could the poor villagers, and poorer
tenants, reckon on their former assistance from the Hall
in the hour of sickness and distress: cowslip wine, currant
wine, elderberry wine, if made, were consumed in
the Hall. In short, there was a discontinuance of all
those innumerable little endearing courtesies, and charities,
and hospitalities, which render a good old country
mansion the very <i>heart</i> of the neighborhood. The doctor
in one of his letters, intimated, with a sort of agony,
that he had heard it mentioned by the people at the
Hall as probable, that Mr. Titmouse&mdash;the little Goth&mdash;would
pull down that noble old relic, the turreted gateway;
but that Mr. Gammon was vehemently opposed to
such a measure; and that, if it were preserved after all,
it would be entirely owing to the taste and the influence
of that gentleman. Had Dr. Tatham chosen, he could
have added a fact which would indeed have saddened his
friends&mdash;viz. that the old sycamore, which had been
preserved at the fond entreaties of Kate, and which was
hallowed by so many sad and tender associations, had
been long ago removed, as a sort of eyesore: Mr. Gammon
had, in fact, directed it to be done; but he repeatedly
expressed to Dr. Tatham, confidentially, his regret
at such an act on the part of Titmouse. The doctor could
also have told them that there had been a dog-fight in
the village, at which Mr. Titmouse was present! Persons
were beginning to make their appearance too, at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
Yatton, of a very different description from any who had
been seen there in the time of the Aubreys&mdash;persons,
now and then, of loose, and wild, and reckless characters.
Mr. Titmouse would often get up a fight in the village,
and reward the victor with five or ten shillings! Then
the snug and quiet little "Aubrey Arms" was metamorphosed
into the "Titmouse Arms" and another set up
in opposition to it, and called "The Toper's Arms;" and
it was really painful to see the increasing trade driven by
each of them. They were both full every night, and
often during the day also; and the vigilant, and affectionate,
and grieved eye of the good vicar noticed several
seats in the church, which had formerly been occupied
every Sunday morning and afternoon, to be&mdash;empty!
In his letters, he considerately sank the grosser features
of Titmouse's conduct, which would have only uselessly
grieved and disgusted his beloved correspondents. He
informed them, however, from time to time, of the different
visitors at the Hall, particularly of the arrival and
movements of their magnificent kinsfolk, the Earl of
Dreddlington and Lady Cecilia, the Marquis Gants-Jaunes
de Millefleurs and Mr. Tuft&mdash;the novel state and ceremony
which had been suddenly introduced there&mdash;at
which they all ceased reading for a moment, and laughed,
well knowing the character of Lord Dreddlington. At
length, some considerable time after Mr. Titmouse's grand
visitors had been at the Hall, there came a letter from
Dr. Tatham, sent by a private hand, and not reaching
Vivian Street till the evening, when they were sitting
together, after dinner, as usual, and which contained intelligence
that was received in sudden silence, and with
looks of astonishment; viz. <i>that Mr. Titmouse had become
the acknowledged suitor of the Lady Cecilia</i>!! Mr. Aubrey,
after a moment's pause, laughed more heartily than they
had heard him laugh for many months&mdash;getting up,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
at the same time, and walking once or twice across the
room&mdash;Mrs. Aubrey and Miss Aubrey gazed at each
other for a few moments, without speaking a word; and
you could not have told whether their fair countenances
showed more of amusement or of disgust at the intelligence.
"Well! it is as I have often told you, Kate,"
commenced Mr. Aubrey, after a while resuming his seat,
and addressing his sister with an air of good-humored
raillery; "you've lost your chance&mdash;you've held your
head so high. Ah, 'tis all over now&mdash;and our fair cousin
is mistress of Yatton!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Charles," quoth Kate, earnestly, "I do think
it's too painful a subject for a joke."</p>

<p>"Why, Kate!&mdash;You must bear it as well"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pho, pho&mdash;nonsense, Charles! To be serious&mdash;did
you ever hear anything so shocking as"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me, Kate," commenced her
brother, assuming suddenly such a serious air as for a
moment imposed on his sister, "that to become mistress
of dear old Yatton&mdash;which was <i>offered</i> to you, you know&mdash;you
would not have consented, when it came to the
point, to become&mdash;Mrs. <i>Titmouse</i>?" For an instant,
Kate looked as if she would have made, in the eye of the
statuary, an exquisite model of beautiful disdain&mdash;provoked
by the bare idea even, and put forward, as she
knew, in raillery only. "You know, Charles," said she
at length, calmly, her features relaxing into a smile,
"that if such a wretch had ten thousand Yattons, I
would, rather than marry him&mdash;oh!"&mdash;she shuddered&mdash;"spring
from Dover cliff into the sea!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Kate, Kate!" exclaimed her brother, with a
look of infinite pride and fondness. "Even supposing
for a moment that you had no prev"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, Charles, no more nonsense," said Kate, patting
his cheek, and slightly coloring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say, that even if"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Only fancy," interrupted Kate, "<i>Lady Cecilia</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Titmouse</span>!
I see her before me now. Well, I protest it is
positively insufferable; I could not have thought that
there was a woman in the whole world&mdash;why"&mdash;she
paused, and added laughingly, "how I should like to see
their correspondence!"</p>

<p>"What!" said Mrs. Aubrey, with a sly smile, first at
her husband, and then at Kate, "as a model for a certain
<i>other</i> correspondence that I can imagine&mdash;eh, Kate!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, nonsense, Agnes!&mdash;what a provoking
humor you are both in this evening," interrupted Kate,
with a slight pettishness; "what we've heard makes <i>me</i>
melancholy enough, I assure you!"</p>

<p>"I suppose that about the same time that Lady Cecilia
Titmouse goes to court," said her brother, "so will
the Honorable Mrs. Dela"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you choose to tease me, Charles, of course I cannot
help it," quoth Kate, coloring still more; but it required
no <i>very</i> great acuteness to detect that the topic
was not excessively offensive.</p>

<p>"Mrs. De"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have done, Charles!" said she, rising; and, putting
her arm round his neck, she pressed her fair hand on his
mouth; but he pushed it aside laughingly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. De&mdash;Dela&mdash;Delamere," he continued.</p>

<p>"I will finish it for you, Charles," said Mrs. Aubrey,
"the Honorable Mr. and Mrs. Delamere"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What! do <i>you</i> turn against me too?" inquired Kate,
laughing very good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"I wonder what her stately Ladyship's feelings were,"
said Aubrey, after a pause, "the first time that her elegant
and accomplished lover <i>saluted</i> her!!"</p>

<p>"Eugh!" exclaimed both Kate and Mrs. Aubrey, in a
breath, and with a simultaneous shudder of disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<p>"I dare say poor old Lord Dreddlington's notion is,
that this will be a fine opportunity for bringing about
his favorite scheme of <i>reuniting the families</i>&mdash;Heaven
save the mark!" said Mr. Aubrey, just as the twopenny
postman's knock at the door was heard; and within a
few moments' time the servant brought up-stairs a letter
addressed to Mr. Aubrey. The very first glance at its
contents expelled the smile from his countenance, and
the color from his cheek: he turned, in fact, so pale, that
Mrs. Aubrey and Kate also changed color&mdash;and came
and stood with beating hearts, and suddenly suspended
breath, one on each side of him, looking over the letter
while he was reading it. As I intend presently to lay a
copy of it before the reader, I shall first state a few circumstances,
which will make it appear that this same
letter may be compared to a shell thrown into a peaceful
little citadel, by a skilful, though distant and unseen
engineer&mdash;in short, I mean Mr. Gammon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p>The astute and determined person mentioned at the
close of our last chapter, had long been bent upon securing
one object&mdash;namely, access to Mr. Aubrey's family
circle, for reasons which have been already communicated
to the reader. That Mr. Aubrey was, at all events, by
no means <i>anxious</i> for such a favor, had been long before
abundantly manifest to Gammon, and yet not in a way
to give him any legitimate, or excusable, grounds of offence.
The Aubreys had, he acknowledged, and especially
in their present circumstances, an unquestionable
right to receive or reject, as they thought fit, any overtures
to acquaintance. Nothing, he felt, could be more
unexceptionably courteous than Mr. Aubrey's demeanor;
yet had it been such as to satisfy him, that unless he
resorted to some means of unusual efficacy, he never
could get upon visiting terms with the Aubreys. The
impression which Miss Aubrey had originally produced
in his mind, remained as distinct and vivid as ever. Her
beauty, her grace, her elevated character, (of which he
had heard much on all hands,) her accomplishments, her
high birth&mdash;all were exquisitely appreciated by him, and
conspired to constitute a prize, for the gaining of which he
deemed no exertion too great, no sacrifice too serious, no
enterprise too hazardous. He had, moreover, other most
important objects in view, to which a union with Miss
Aubrey was in fact essential. She was, again, the only
person, the sight of whom had in any measure given
vitality to his marble heart, exciting totally new thoughts
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
and desires, such as stimulated him to a fierce and inflexible
determination to succeed in his purposes. He
was, in short, prepared to make almost any sacrifice, to
wait any length of time, to do or suffer anything that
man could do or suffer, whether derogatory to his personal
honor or not&mdash;in order either to secure the affections
of Miss Aubrey, or, at all events, her consent to a
union with him. Having early discovered the spot where
Mr. Aubrey had fixed his residence, Mr. Gammon had
made a point of lying in wait on a Sunday morning, for
the purpose of ascertaining the church to which they
went; and having succeeded, he became a constant, an
impassioned, though an unseen observer of Miss Aubrey,
from whom he seldom removed his eyes during the service.
But this was to him a highly unsatisfactory state
of things: he seemed, in fact, not to have made, nor to
be likely to make, the least progress towards the accomplishment
of his wishes, though much time had already
passed away. He was so deeply engrossed with the affairs
of Titmouse&mdash;which required his presence very frequently
at Yatton, and a great deal of his attention in
town&mdash;as to prevent his taking any decisive steps for
some time in the matter nearest his heart. At length,
not having seen or heard anything of Mr. Aubrey for
some weeks, during which he&mdash;Gammon&mdash;had been in
town, he resolved on a new stroke of policy.</p>

<p>"Mr. Quirk," said he one day to his excellent senior
partner, "I fancy you will say that I am come to flatter
you; but, Heaven knows!&mdash;if there <i>is</i> a man on the earth
with whom I lay aside disguise, that man is my friend
Mr. Quirk. Really, it does seem, and mortifying enough
it is to own it, as if events invariably showed that you are
right&mdash;that I am wrong"&mdash;(Here Mr. Quirk's appearance
might have suggested the idea of a great old tom-cat
who is rubbed down the right way of the fur, and does
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
everything he can to testify the delight it gives him, by
pressing against the person who affords him such gratification,)&mdash;"especially
in financial matters"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, Gammon, Gammon! you're really past finding
out!&mdash;Sometimes, now, I declare I fancy you the very
keenest dog going in such matters, and at other times,
eh?&mdash;not <i>particularly</i> brilliant. When you've seen as
much of this world's villany, Gammon, as I have, you'll
find it as necessary as I have found it, to lay aside one's&mdash;one's&mdash;I
say&mdash;to lay aside all scrup&mdash;&mdash;that is&mdash;I
mean&mdash;one's <i>fine feelings</i>, and so forth; you understand,
Gammon?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, Mr. Quirk"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and may I ask, Gammon, what is the particular
occasion of that screwed-up forehead of yours? Something
in the wind?"</p>

<p>"Only this, Mr. Quirk&mdash;I begin to suspect that I did
very wrong in recommending you to give an indefinite time
to that Mr. Aubrey for payment of the heavy balance
he owes us&mdash;by Heavens!&mdash;see how coolly he treats
us!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Gammon, I think so!&mdash;Besides&mdash;<i>'tis</i> an
uncommon heavy balance to owe so long, eh?&mdash;Fifteen
hundred pounds, or thereabouts?&mdash;Gad, it's <i>that</i>, at
least!"&mdash;Gammon shrugged his shoulders and bowed,
as if resigned to any step which Mr. Quirk might think
proper to take.</p>

<p>"He's a villanous proud fellow, that Aubrey, eh?&mdash;Your
tip-top debtors generally <i>are</i>, though&mdash;when they've
got a bit of a hardship to harp upon"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Certainly we ought, when we had him in our
power"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;D'ye recollect, Gammon? the <i>thumbscrew</i>?
eh? whose fault was it that it wasn't put on? eh? Tell
me that, friend Gammon! Are you coming round to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
old Caleb Quirk's matter-of-fact way of doing business?
Depend on't, the old boy has got a trick or two left in
him yet, gray as his hair's grown."</p>

<p>"I bow, my dear sir&mdash;I own myself worsted&mdash;and all
through that absurd weakness I have, which some choose
to call"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, Gammon! Bubble, bubble and botheration&mdash;ah,
ha!&mdash;Come, there's nobody here but you and me&mdash;and
eh? <i>old Bogy</i> perhaps&mdash;so, why that little bit of
blarney?"</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear Mr. Quirk, spare me that cutting irony
of yours. Surely when I have made the sincere and humiliating
submission to which you have been listening&mdash;but,
to return to business. I assure you that I think we
ought to lose not a moment in getting in our balance,
or at least coming to some satisfactory and definite arrangement
concerning it. Only pinch him, and he'll bleed
freely, depend on it."</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Pinch him, and he'll bleed! That's <i>my</i>
thunder, Gammon, ah, ha, ha!&mdash;By Jove! that's it to a
T!&mdash;I always thought the fellow had blood enough in
him if we only squeezed him a little. So let Snap be off
and have a writ out against Master Aubrey."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, my dear Mr. Quirk," interrupted Gammon,
blandly&mdash;"we must go very cautiously to work, or
we shall only injure ourselves, and prejudice our most important&mdash;and
<i>permanent</i> interests. We must take care
not to drive him desperate, poor devil, or he may take the
benefit of the act, and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a cursed scamp he would be to"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Certainly; but <i>we</i> should suffer more than he"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Surely, Gammon, they'd <i>remand</i> him!  Eighteen
months at the very least."</p>

<p>"Not an hour&mdash;not a minute, Mr. Quirk," said Gammon,
very earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>"The deuce they wouldn't? Well, Law's come to a
pretty point! And so lenient as we've been!"</p>

<p>"What occurs to <i>me</i> as the best method of procedure,"
said Gammon, after musing for a moment&mdash;"is, for you
to write a letter to him immediately&mdash;civil but peremptory&mdash;just
one of those letters of yours, my dear sir, in
which no living man can excel you&mdash;<i>suaviter in modo,
fortiter in re</i>, Mr. Quirk."</p>

<p>"Gammon, you're a gentleman, every inch of you&mdash;you
are, upon my soul! If there <i>is</i> one thing in which I&mdash;&mdash;but
<i>you're</i> a hand at a letter of that sort, too! And
<i>you</i> have managed these people hitherto; why not go on
to the end of the chapter?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Quirk, I look upon this letter as rather an important
one&mdash;it ought to come from the head of the firm,
and to be decisively and skilfully expressed, so as at once to&mdash;&mdash;eh?
but you know exactly what ought to be done."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;leave it to me,&mdash;leave it to me, Gammon: I
think I <i>do</i> know how to draw up a teaser&mdash;egad! You
can just cast your eye over it as soon as"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I return in time from Clerkenwell, I will, Mr.
Quirk," replied Gammon, who had, however, determined
not to disable himself from saying with literal truth that
he had not seen one line of the letter which might be
sent! and, moreover, resolving to make his appearance at
Mr. Aubrey's almost immediately after he should, in the
course of the post, have received Mr. Quirk's communication:&mdash;with
every appearance and <i>expression</i> of distress,
agitation, and even disgust; indignantly assuring Mr.
Aubrey that the letter had been sent without Mr. Gammon's
knowledge&mdash;against his will&mdash;and was entirely
repudiated by him; and that he would take care, at all
hazards to himself, to frustrate any designs on the part
of his coarse and hard-hearted senior partner to harass or
oppress Mr. Aubrey. With this explanation of precedent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
circumstances, I proceed to lay before the reader an exact
copy of the elegant letter of that old cat's-paw, Mr. Quirk,
to Mr. Aubrey, the arrival of which had produced the sensation
to which I have already alluded.</p>

<blockquote>

<div align="right">  "<i>Saffron Hill, 30th September 18&mdash;.</i> </div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;We trust you will excuse our reminding you of the
very large balance (£1,446, 14s. 6d.) still remaining due upon
our account&mdash;and which we understood, at the time when the
very favorable arrangement to you, with respect to Mr. Titmouse,
was made, was to have been long before this liquidated.
Whatever allowances we might have felt disposed, on account
of your peculiar situation, to have made, (and which we <i>have</i>
made,) we cannot but feel a little surprised at your having allowed
several months to elapse without making any allusion
thereto. We are satisfied, however, that you require only to be
reminded thereof, to have your immediate attention directed
thereto, and to act in that way that will conduce to liquidate
our very heavy balance against you. We are sorry to have to
press you; but being much pressed ourselves with serious outlays,
we are obliged to throw ourselves (however reluctantly)
upon our resources; and it gives us pleasure to anticipate, that
you must by this time have made those arrangements that will
admit of your immediate attention to our over-due account, and
that will render unnecessary our resorting to hostile and compulsory
proceedings of that extremely painful description that we
have always felt extremely reluctant to, particularly with those
gentlemen that would feel it very disagreeable. We trust that
in a week's time we shall hear from you to that effect, that will
render unnecessary our proceeding to extremities against you,
which would be extremely painful to us.&mdash;We remain, sir,
yours, most obediently,</p>

<div align="right"> "<span class="smcap">Quirk, Gammon, &amp; Snap.</span> </div>

<div align="left"> "<span class="smcap">Charles Aubrey, Esq.</span> </div>


<p>"P. S.&mdash;We should have no objection, if it would materially
relieve you, to take your note of hand for the aforesaid balance
(£1,446, 14s. 6d.) at two months, with interest, and good security.
Or say, £800 down in two months, and a <i>warrant of
attorney</i> for the remainder, at two months more."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as they had finished reading the above letter,
in the way I have described, Mrs. Aubrey threw her arms
round her silent and oppressed husband's neck, and Kate,
her bosom heaving with agitation, returned to her seat
without uttering a word.</p>

<p>"My own poor Charles!" faltered Mrs. Aubrey, and
wept.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Charles&mdash;let us hope that we shall get
through even <i>this</i>," commenced Kate; when her emotion
prevented her proceeding. Mr. Aubrey appeared to cast
his eye again, but mechanically only, over the dry, civil,
heart-breaking letter.</p>

<p>"Don't distress yourself, my Agnes," said he, tenderly,
placing her beside him, with his arm round her&mdash;"it is
only reasonable that these people should ask for what is
their own; and if their manner is a little coarse"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I've no patience, Charles!&mdash;it's the letter of a
vulgar, hard-hearted fellow," sobbed Mrs. Aubrey.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;they are wretches!&mdash;cruel harpies!" quoth
Kate, passionately&mdash;"they know that you have almost
beggared yourself to pay off by far the greater part of
their abominable bill; and that you are slaving day and
night to enable you to"&mdash;&mdash;here her agitation was so
excessive as to prevent her uttering another word.</p>

<p>"I must write and tell them," said Aubrey, calmly but
with a countenance laden with gloom&mdash;"it is all I can
do&mdash;that if they will <i>have patience with me, I will pay
them all</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll put you in prison, Charles, directly"&mdash;said
Kate, almost frantically; and rising, she threw herself
into his arms, and kissed him with a sort of frenzied
energy. "We're <i>very</i> miserable, Charles&mdash;are we not?
It's hard to bear indeed," she continued, gazing with agonizing
intensity on his troubled features. Mrs. Aubrey
wept in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you giving way, my brave Kate, beneath this
sudden and momentary gust on the midnight sea of our
trouble?" inquired her brother, proudly but kindly gazing
at her, and with his hand gently pushing from her
pale cheeks her disordered hair.</p>

<p>"Human nature, Charles, must not be tried too far&mdash;look
at Agnes, and the darling little loves"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am not likely to consult their interests, Kate, by
yielding to unmanly emotion&mdash;am I, sweet Agnes?"
She made him no reply, but shook her head, sobbing
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Pray what do you think, Charles, of your friend <i>Mr.
Gammon</i>, now?" inquired Kate, suddenly and scornfully.
"Oh, the smooth-tongued villain! I've always hated
him!"</p>

<p>"I must say there's something about his eye that is
anything but pleasing," said Mrs. Aubrey; "and so I
thought when I saw him at York for a moment."</p>

<p>"He's a hypocrite, Charles&mdash;depend upon it, and in
this letter he has thrown off the mask"&mdash;interrupted
Kate.</p>

<p>"But <i>is</i> it <i>his</i> letter? How do we know that he has
had anything to do with it?" inquired her brother, calmly&mdash;"It
is much more probable that it is the production
of old Mr. Quirk alone, for whom Mr. Gammon has, I
know, a profound contempt. The handwriting is Mr.
Quirk's; the style is assuredly not Mr. Gammon's; and
the whole tone of the communication is such as satisfies
me that neither was the composition of the letter, nor the
idea of sending it, his; besides, he has really shown on
every occasion a straightforward and disinterested"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Charles, it is very weak of you to be so hood-winked
by such a fellow; I shudder to think of him!
One of these days, Charles, you will be of my opinion,
and recollect what I now say!"&mdash;While she thus spoke,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
and Mrs. Aubrey was, with a trembling hand, preparing
tea, a double knock was heard at the street door.</p>

<p>"Heavens, Charles! who can that possibly be, and at this
time of night?" exclaimed Kate, with alarmed energy.</p>

<p>"I really cannot conjecture"&mdash;replied Mr. Aubrey,
with an agitation of manner which he found it impossible
to conceal&mdash;"we've certainly but very few visitors&mdash;and
it is so late." The servant in a few minutes terminated
their suspense, and occasioned them nearly equal
alarm and amazement, by laying down on the table a card
bearing the name of <span class="smcap">Mr. Gammon</span>.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gammon!" exclaimed all three, in a breath, looking
apprehensively at each other&mdash;"Is he <i>alone</i>?" inquired
Mr. Aubrey, with forced calmness.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Show him into the study, then," replied Mr. Aubrey,
"and say I will be with him in a few moments' time."</p>

<p>"Dear Charles, don't, dearest, think of going down,"
said his wife and sister, with excessive alarm and agitation;
"desire him to send up his message."</p>

<p>"No, I shall go and see him, and at once," replied Mr.
Aubrey, taking one of the candles.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Charles, mind what you say to the
man: he will watch every word you utter. And, dearest,
don't stay long; consider what tortures we shall be in!"
said poor Mrs. Aubrey, accompanying him to the door,
and trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Rely on my prudence, and also that I shall not stop
long," he replied; and descending the stairs, he entered
the study. In a chair near the little book-strewn table
sat his dreaded visitor&mdash;suggesting to his disturbed vision
the idea of a deadly snake coiled up before him. Instantly,
on seeing Mr. Aubrey, Gammon rose, with distress
and agitation visible in his countenance and deportment.
Mr. Aubrey, with calmness and dignity, begged him to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
resume his seat; and when he had done so, sat down opposite
to him, with a sternly inquisitive look, awaiting his
visitor's errand. He was not kept long in suspense.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Aubrey!" commenced Mr. Gammon, with a
somewhat tremulous voice, "I perceive, from your manner,
that my fears are justified, and that I am an intruder&mdash;a
dishonorable and hypocritical one I must indeed appear; but,
as I have done nothing to forfeit my right to
be treated as should be one gentleman by another, I request
you to hear me. This visit appears indeed unseasonable;
but, late this afternoon, I made a discovery which
has shocked me severely, nay, I may say, disgusted me beyond
expression. Am I right, Mr. Aubrey, in supposing
that this evening you have received a letter from Mr.
Quirk, and about the balance due on our account?"</p>

<p>"I have, sir," replied Mr. Aubrey, coldly.</p>

<p>"I thought as much," muttered Gammon, with suppressed
vehemence&mdash;"execrable, heartless, sordid old&mdash;&mdash;And
he <i>knew</i>," continued Gammon, addressing Mr.
Aubrey in an indignant tone, "that my word was solemnly
pledged to you."</p>

<p>"I have no intention of making any complaint, or uttering
any reproaches, sir," said Mr. Aubrey, eying his
agitated companion searchingly.</p>

<p>"But <i>I</i> have, Mr. Aubrey," said Gammon, haughtily.
"My senior partner has broken faith with me. Sir, you
have already paid more than will cover what is justly due
to us; and I recommend you, after this, to <i>have the bill
taxed</i>. You will thereby get rid of every farthing of the
balance now demanded; and I give you this recommendation
<i>bonâ fide</i>, and upon the honor of a gentleman."
Notwithstanding the air of sincerity with which this was
uttered, a cold thrill of apprehension and suspicion passed
through Mr. Aubrey's heart, and he felt confident that
some subtle and dangerous man&#339;uvre was being practised
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
upon him&mdash;that he was urged to take some hostile step
for instance&mdash;which would be unsuccessful, and yet afford
a pretext to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, to
treat him as one guilty of a breach of faith, and <i>warrant
them in proceeding to extremities</i>. He regarded Mr. Gammon's
words as the hissing of a serpent, and shuddered.</p>

<p>"I have no intention, sir, to do anything of the kind,"
said Mr. Aubrey. "The original agreement between us
was, that your bill should not be taxed. I adhere to it;
and whatever course you may feel disposed to adopt, I shall
take no steps whatever of the kind you mention. At the
same time it is utterly impossible for me to pay"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Aubrey!" interrupted Gammon, imploringly.</p>

<p>"And what you do intend to do, for Heaven's sake, sir,
do quickly, and keep me not in suspense."</p>

<p>"I perceive, Mr. Aubrey, that notwithstanding what I
have said, I am distrusted," replied Gammon, with a somewhat
proud and peremptory tone and manner.&mdash;"I excuse
it; you are justly irritated, and have been insulted:
so have I, too, sir; and I choose to repeat to you, upon
my sacred word of honor as a gentleman, and in the sight
of Heaven, that I entirely disown and scout this whole
procedure; that I never knew anything about it till, accidentally,
I discovered lying on Mr. Quirk's desk, after
his departure this evening from the office, a rough draft
of a letter which I presumed you had received; especially
as, on a strict inquiry of the clerks, I found that a letter
had been put into the post, addressed to you. Nay,
more; Mr. Quirk, whose rapacity increases&mdash;I grieve to
own&mdash;with his years, has been for many weeks harassing
me about this detestable business, and urging me to consent,
but in vain, to such an application as he has now
meanly made behind my back, regardless of the injury it
was calculated to do my feelings, and, indeed, the doubt
it must throw over my sincerity and honor, which I prize
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
infinitely beyond life itself. Only a fortnight ago, Mr. Aubrey,
this old man solemnly pledged himself," continued
Gammon, with suppressed fury, "never to mention the
matter to either me or you, again, for at least a couple of
years, unless something extraordinary should intervene!&mdash;If
the letter which you have received be a transcript
of the rough draft which I have read, it is a vulgar, unfeeling,
brutal letter, and contains, moreover&mdash;for why
should I keep faith with even my senior partner, who has
so outrageously broken faith with me?&mdash;two or three
wilfully false statements. I therefore feel it due to myself
to disavow all participation in this miserable product
of fraud and extortion&mdash;and if you still distrust me, I
can only regret it, but shall not presume to find fault
with you for it. I am half disposed, on account of this,
and one or two other things which have happened, to close
my connection with Mr. Quirk from this day&mdash;forever.
He and I have nothing in common; and the species of
business which he and Mr. Snap chiefly court and relish,
is perfectly odious to me. But if I should continue in
the firm, I will undertake to supply you with one pretty
conclusive evidence of my sincerity and truth in what I
have been saying to you&mdash;namely, that on the faith and
honor of a gentleman, you may depend upon hearing no
more of this matter from any member of our firm, except
from me, and that at a very remote period. Let the
<i>event</i>, Mr. Aubrey, speak for itself."&mdash;While Gammon was
speaking with eloquent earnestness and fervor, he had felt
Mr. Aubrey's eye fixed on him with an expression of stern
incredulity&mdash;which, however, he at length perceived, with
infinite inward relief and pleasure, to be giving way as he
went on.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Gammon"&mdash;said Mr. Aubrey, in a
very different tone and manner from that which he had till
then adopted&mdash;"I will not disguise from you that the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
letter you have mentioned, has occasioned me&mdash;and my
family&mdash;deep distress and dismay; for it is utterly out
of my power to comply with its requisitions: and if it be
intended to be really acted on, and followed up"&mdash;he
paused, and with difficulty repressed his emotions, "all
my little plans are forever frustrated&mdash;and I am at your
mercy&mdash;to go to prison, if you choose, and there end my
days."&mdash;He paused&mdash;his lip trembled, and his eyes were
for a moment obscured with starting tears. So also was
it with Mr. Gammon, who looked for some time aside.
"But,"&mdash;resumed Mr. Aubrey,&mdash;"after the explicit and
voluntary assurance which you have given me, I feel it
impossible not to give you implicit credence. I can imagine
no motive for what would be otherwise such elaborate
and dreadful deception!"</p>

<p>"<i>Motive</i>, Mr. Aubrey! The only motive I am conscious
of, is one supplied by profound sympathy for your
misfortunes&mdash;admiration of your character&mdash;and my
sole object is, your speedy extrication from your very serious
embarrassments. I am in the habit, Mr. Aubrey,"
he continued in a lower tone, "of concealing and checking
my feelings&mdash;but there <i>are</i> occasions"&mdash;he paused,
and added with a somewhat faltering voice&mdash;"Mr. Aubrey,
it pains me inexpressibly to observe that your
anxieties&mdash;your severe exertions&mdash;I trust in God I may
not rightly add, your <i>privations</i>&mdash;are telling on your appearance.
You are certainly much thinner." It was
impossible any longer to distrust the sincerity of Mr.
Gammon&mdash;to withstand the arts of this consummate
actor. Mr. Aubrey held out long, but at length surrendered
entirely, and fully believed all that Gammon had
said:&mdash;entertaining, moreover, commensurate feelings of
<i>gratitude</i>, towards one who had done so much to protect
him from rapacious avarice, and the ruin into which it
would have precipitated him; and of <i>respect</i>, for one who
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
had evinced such an anxious, scrupulous, and sensitive
jealousy for his own honor and reputation, and resolute
determination to vindicate it against suspicion. Subsequent
conversation served to strengthen his favorable disposition
towards Gammon, and the same effect was also
produced when he adverted to his previous and unwarrantable
distrust and disbelief of that gentleman. He
looked fatigued and harassed; it was growing late; he
had come, on his errand of courtesy and kindness, a great
distance: why should not Mr. Aubrey ask him up-stairs,
to join them at tea? To be sure, Mr. Aubrey had hitherto
felt a disinclination&mdash;he scarce knew why&mdash;to have
any more than mere business intercourse with Mr. Gammon,
a member of such a firm as Quirk, Gammon, and
Snap&mdash;and, moreover, Mr. Runnington had more than
once let fall expressions indicative of vehement suspicion
of Mr. Gammon; so had the Attorney-General; but what
had Gammon's <i>conduct</i> been? Had it not practically
given the lie to such insinuations and distrust, unless Mr.
Aubrey was to own himself incapable of forming a judgment
on a man's line of conduct which had been so closely
watched as that of Gammon, by himself, Aubrey? Then
Miss Aubrey had ever, and especially that very evening&mdash;expressed
an intense dislike of Mr. Gammon&mdash;had
avowed, also, her early and uniform disgust&mdash;'twould be
extremely embarrassing to her suddenly to introduce into
her presence such an individual as Gammon: again, he
had promised to return quickly, in order to relieve their
anxiety: why should he not have the inexpressible gratification
of letting Mr. Gammon himself, in his own pointed
and impressive manner, dispel all their fears? He would,
probably, not stay long.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gammon," said he, having balanced for some moments
these conflicting considerations in his mind, "there
are only Mrs. Aubrey, and my sister, Miss Aubrey,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
up-stairs. I am sure they will be happy to see me return
to them in time for tea, accompanied by the bearer
of such agreeable tidings as yours. Mr. Quirk's letter, to
be frank, reached me when in their presence, and we all
read it together, and were distressed and confounded at
its contents." After a faint show of reluctance to trespass
on the ladies so suddenly, and at so late an hour,
Mr. Gammon slipped off his great-coat, and with intense
but suppressed feelings of exultation at the success of his
scheme, followed Mr. Aubrey up-stairs. He was not a little
flustered on entering the room and catching a first
glimpse of the two lovely women&mdash;and one of them <i>Miss
Aubrey</i>&mdash;sitting in it, their faces turned with eager interest
and apprehension towards the door, as he made his
appearance. He observed that both of them started, and
turned excessively pale.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce to you," said Mr. Aubrey, quickly,
and with a bright assuring smile, "a gentleman who has
kindly called to relieve us all from great anxiety&mdash;Mr.
Gammon: Mr. Gammon, Mrs. Aubrey&mdash;Miss Aubrey."
Mr. Gammon bowed with an air of deep deference, but
with easy self-possession; his soul thrilling within him at
the sight of her whose image had never been from before
his eyes since they had first seen her.</p>

<p>"I shall trespass on you for only a few minutes, ladies,"
said he, diffidently, approaching the chair towards which
he was motioned. "I could not resist the opportunity
so politely afforded me by Mr. Aubrey of paying my compliments
here, and personally assuring you of my utter
abhorrence of the mercenary and oppressive conduct of a
person with whom, alas! I am closely connected in business,
and whose letter to you of this evening I only
casually became acquainted with, a few moments before
starting off hither. Forget it, ladies; I pledge my honor
that it shall <i>never be acted on</i>!" This he said with a fervor
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
of manner that could not but make an impression on
those whom he addressed.</p>

<p>"I'm sure we are happy to see you, Mr. Gammon, and
very much obliged to you, indeed," said Mrs. Aubrey,
with a sweet smile, and a face from which alarm was vanishing
fast. Miss Aubrey said nothing; her brilliant eyes
glanced with piercing anxiety, now at her brother, then
at his companion. Gammon felt that he was distrusted.
Nothing could be more prepossessing&mdash;more bland and
insinuating, without a trace of fulsomeness, than his
manner and address, as he took his seat between these
two agitated but lovely women. Miss Aubrey's paleness
rather suddenly gave way to a vivid and beautiful flush;
and her eyes presently sparkled with delighted surprise
on perceiving the relieved air of her brother, and the apparent
cordiality and sincerity of Mr. Gammon. When
she reflected, moreover, on her expressions of harshness
and severity concerning him that very evening, and of
which he now appeared so undeserving, it threw into her
manner towards him a sort of delicate and charming embarrassment.
Her ear drank in eagerly every word he
uttered, so pointed, so significant, so full of earnest good-will
towards her brother. Their visitor's manner was that
of a gentleman; his countenance and conversation were
those of a man of intellect. Was <i>this</i> the keen and cruel
pettifogger whom she had learned at once to dread and
to despise? They and he were, in a word, completely at
their ease with one another, within a few minutes after
he had taken his seat at the tea-table. Miss Aubrey's
beauty shone that evening with even unwonted lustre,
and appeared as if it had not been in the least impaired
by the anguish of mind which she had so long suffered.
'Tis quite impossible for me to do justice to the expression
of her full beaming blue eyes&mdash;an expression of mingled
passion and intellect&mdash;of blended softness and spirit&mdash;such
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
as, especially in conjunction with the rich tones of
her voice, shed something like madness into the breast of
Gammon. She, as well as her lovely sister-in-law, was
dressed in mourning, which infinitely set off her dazzling
complexion, and, simple and elegant in its drapery, displayed
her exquisite proportions to the greatest possible
advantage. "Oh, my God!" thought Gammon, with a
momentary thrill of disgust and horror: "and this is the
transcendent creature of whom that little miscreant, Titmouse,
spoke to me in terms of such presumptuous and
revolting license!" What would he not have given to
kiss the fair and delicate white hand which passed to him
his antique tea-cup! Then Gammon's thoughts turned
for a moment inward&mdash;<i>why, what a scoundrel was he</i>!
At that instant he was, as it were, reeking with his recent
lie. He was there on cruel, false pretences, which alone
had secured him access into that little drawing-room, and
brought him into contiguity with the dazzling beauty beside
him&mdash;pure, and innocent as beautiful;&mdash;he was a
fiend beside an angel. What an execrable hypocrite was
he! He caught, on that memorable occasion, a sudden
glimpse even of his own real inner man&mdash;of his infernal
<small>SELFISHNESS</small> and <small>HYPOCRISY</small>&mdash;and involuntarily shuddered!
Yes&mdash;he was striving to fascinate his <i>victims</i>!&mdash;those
whom he was fast pressing on to the verge of destruction&mdash;against
whom he was, at that moment, meditating
profound and subtle schemes of mischief! At
length they all got into animated conversation.</p>

<p>Though infinitely charmed by the unaffected simplicity
and frankness of their manners, he experienced a sad and
painful consciousness at not having made the least <i>way</i>
with them. Though physically near to them, he seemed
yet really at an unapproachable distance&mdash;and particularly
from Miss Aubrey. He felt that the courtesy bestowed
upon him was accidental, the result merely of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
present position, and of the intelligence which he had
come to communicate. It was not <i>personal</i>&mdash;'twas
nothing to <i>Gammon himself</i>; it would never be renewed,
unless he should renew his device! There was not the
faintest semblance of <i>sympathy</i> between them and him.
Fallen as they were into a lower sphere, they had yet about
them, so to speak, a certain atmosphere of conscious personal
consequence, derived from high birth and breeding&mdash;from
superior feelings and associations&mdash;from a native
frankness and dignity of character, which was indestructible
and inalienable; and which chilled and checked
undue advances of any sort. They were still the Aubreys
of Yatton, and he in their presence, still Mr. Gammon of
the firm of Quirk, Gammon, and Snap, of Saffron Hill&mdash;and
all this, too, without&mdash;on the part of the Aubreys&mdash;the
least effort, the least intention, or even consciousness.
No, there had not been exhibited towards him the
faintest indication of hauteur. On the contrary, he had
been treated with perfect cordiality and frankness. Yet,
dissatisfaction and vexation were, he scarce knew at the
moment why, pervading his whole soul. Had he accurately
analyzed his own feelings he would have discovered
the real clause&mdash;<i>in his own unreasonable, unjustifiable
wishes and intentions</i>!  But to return, they talked of
Titmouse, and his mode of life and conduct&mdash;of his expected
alliance with the Lady Cecilia, at the mention of
which Gammon's quick eye detected a passing smile of
scorn on Miss Aubrey's fine countenance, that was <i>death
to all his own fond and ambitious hopes</i>. After he had
been sitting with them for scarcely an hour, he detected
Miss Aubrey stealthily glancing at her watch, and at once
arose to take his departure with a very easy and graceful
air, expressing an apprehension that he had trespassed
upon their kindness. He was cordially assured to the
contrary; but at the same time was not invited either
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
to prolong his stay, or renew his visit. Miss Aubrey made
him, he thought, as he inclined towards her, <i>rather</i> a formal
courtesy; and the tone of voice&mdash;soft and silvery&mdash;in
which she said "good-night, Mr. Gammon," fell on his
eager ear, and sank into his vexed heart, like music. On
quitting the house, a deep sigh of disappointment escaped
him. As he gazed for a moment with longing eyes at the
windows of the room in which Miss Aubrey was sitting,
he felt profound depression of spirit. He had altogether
<i>failed</i>; and he had a sort of insupportable consciousness
that he deserved to fail, on every account. Her image
was before his mind's eye every moment while he was
threading his way back to his chambers in Thavies' Inn.
He sat for an hour or two before the remnant of his fire,
lost in a revery; and sleep came not to his eyes till a
very late hour in the morning.</p>

<p>Just as the tortuous mind of Gammon was loosing hold
of its sinister purposes in sleep, Mr. Aubrey might have
been seen taking his seat in his little study, having himself
spent a restless night. 'Twas little more than half-past
four o'clock when he entered, candle in hand, the
scene of his early and cheerful labors, and sat down before
his table, which was covered with loose manuscripts
and books. His face was certainly overcast with anxiety,
but his soul was calm and resolute. Having lit his fire,
he placed his shaded candle upon the table, and leaning
back for a moment in his chair, while the flickering increasing
light of his crackling fire and of the candle,
revealed to him, with a sense of indescribable snugness,
his shelves crammed with books, and the window covered
with an ample crimson curtain, effectually excluding the
chill morning air&mdash;he reflected with a heavy sigh upon
the precarious tenure by which he held the little comforts
yet thus left to him. Oh, thought he&mdash;if Providence
saw fit to relieve me from the frightful pressure of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
liability under which I am bound to the earth, at what
labor, at what privation would I repine! What gladness
would not spring up in my heart!&mdash;But rousing himself
from vain thoughts of this kind, he began to arrange his
manuscripts; when his ear caught a sound on the stair&mdash;'twas
the light stealthy step of his sister, coming down
to perform her promised undertaking&mdash;not an unusual
one by any means&mdash;to transcribe for the press the manuscript
which he expected to complete that morning. "My
sweet Kate," said he, tenderly, as she entered with her
little chamber light, extinguishing it as she entered,&mdash;"I
am really grieved to see you stirring so early&mdash;do,
dearest Kate&mdash;go back to bed." But she kissed his
cheek affectionately, and refused to do any such thing;
and telling him of the restless night she had passed, of
which indeed her pale and depressed features bore but
too legible evidence, she sat herself down in her accustomed
place, nearly opposite to him; gently cleared away
space enough for her little desk, and then opening it, was
presently engaged in her delightful task&mdash;for to her it
<i>was</i> indeed delightful&mdash;of copying out her brother's composition.
Thus she sat, silent and industrious&mdash;scarce
opening her lips, except to ask him to explain an illegible
word or so&mdash;opposite to her doting brother, till the
hour had arrived&mdash;eight o'clock&mdash;for the close of their
morning toil. The reader will be pleased to hear that
the article on which they had been thus engaged&mdash;and
which was the discussion of a question of foreign politics,
of great difficulty and importance&mdash;produced him
a check for sixty guineas, and excited general attention
and admiration. Oh, how precious was this reward of
his honorable and severe toil! How it cheered him who
had earned it, and those who were, alas! entirely dependent
upon his exertions! And how sensibly, too, it
augmented their little means! Grateful, indeed, were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
all of them for the success which had attended his
labors!</p>

<p>As I do not intend to occupy the reader with any details
relating to Mr. Aubrey's Temple avocations, I shall
content myself with saying that the more Mr. Weasel
and Mr. Aubrey came to know of each other, the more
Aubrey respected his legal knowledge and ability, and he,
Aubrey's intellectual energy and successful application;
which, indeed, consciously brought home to Aubrey its
own reward, in the daily acquisition of solid learning,
and increasing facility in the use of it. His mind was
formed for <small>THINGS</small>, and was not apt to occupy itself with
mere <i>words</i>, or technicalities. He was ever in quest of
the principles of law&mdash;of its reason, and spirit. He
quickly began to appreciate the sound practical good
sense on which almost all its chief rules are founded,
and the effectual manner in which they are accommodated
to the innumerable and ever-varying exigencies of
human affairs. The mere forms and technicalities of the
law, Mr. Aubrey often thought might be compared to
short-hand, whose characters to the uninitiated appear
quaint and useless, but are perfectly invaluable to him
who has seen the object, and patiently acquired the use of
them. Whatever Mr. Aubrey's hand found to do, while
studying the law, he did it, indeed, <i>with his might</i>&mdash;which
is the grand secret of the difference in the success of different
persons addressing themselves to legal studies. Great
or small, easy or difficult, simple or complicated, interesting
or uninteresting, as might be the affair submitted
to him, he made a point of mastering it thoroughly, and,
as far as possible, <i>by his own efforts</i>; which generated,
early, a habit of self-reliance which no one better than he
knew the value of&mdash;how inestimable, how indispensable,
not to the lawyer merely, but to any one intrusted
with the responsible management of affairs. In short,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
he secured that satisfaction and success which are sure
to attend the exertions of a man of superior sense and
spirit, who is in earnest about that which he has undertaken.
He frequently surprised Mr. Weasel with the
exactness and extent of his legal information&mdash;with his
acuteness, clear-headedness, and tenacity in dealing with
matters of downright difficulty: and Mr. Weasel had once
or twice an opportunity of expressing his very flattering
opinion concerning Mr. Aubrey to the Attorney-General.
The mention of that eminent person reminds me of an
observation which I intended to have made some time
ago. The reader is not to imagine, from my silence upon
the subject, that Mr. Aubrey, in his fallen fortunes, was
heartlessly forgotten or neglected by the distinguished
friends and associates of former and more prosperous
days. It was not they who withdrew from him, but he
who withdrew from them; and that, too, of set purpose,
resolutely adhered to, on the ground that it could not
be otherwise, without seriously interfering with the due
prosecution of those plans of life on which depended not
only his <i>all</i>, and that of those connected with him&mdash;but
his fond hopes of yet extricating himself, by his own personal
exertions, from the direful difficulties and dangers
which at present environed him&mdash;of achieving, with his
own right hand, independence. Let me not forget here
to state a fact which I conceive infinitely to redound to
poor Aubrey's honor&mdash;viz. that he thrice refused offers
made him from very high quarters, of considerable <i>sinecures,
i. e.</i> handsome salaries for purely nominal services&mdash;which
he was earnestly and repeatedly reminded would
at once afford him a liberal maintenance, and leave the
whole of his time at his own disposal, to follow any pursuit
or profession which he chose. Mr. Aubrey justly
considered that it was very difficult, if not indeed impossible,
for any honorable and high-minded man to be a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
sinecurist.&mdash;He who holds a sinecure, is, in my opinion,
plundering the public; and how it can be more contrary
to the dictates of honor and justice, deliberately to defraud
an individual, than deliberately and audaciously to
defraud that collection of individuals called the public, let
casuists determine. As for Mr. Aubrey, <i>he</i> saw stretching
before him the clear, straight, bright line of honor,
and resolved to follow it, without faltering or wavering,
come what come might.  He resolved that, with the
blessing of Providence, his own exertions should procure
his bread, and, if such was the will of Heaven, lead him
to distinction among mankind. He had formed this determination,
and resolved to work it out&mdash;never to
pause, nor give way, but to die in the struggle. Such a
spirit must conquer whatever is opposed to it. What is
<i>difficulty</i>? Only a word indicating the degree of strength
requisite for accomplishing particular objects; a mere
notice of the necessity for exertion; a bugbear to children
and fools; an effective stimulus to men.</p>

<p>Mr. Gammon experienced little trouble in wheedling
Mr. Quirk out of his purpose of enforcing payment, by
Mr. Aubrey, of the balance of his account; demonstrating
to the old gentleman the policy of waiting a little
longer. He pledged himself, when the proper time came,
to adopt measures of undoubted efficacy&mdash;assuring his
for some time sullen senior, in a low tone, that since
his letter had reached Mr. Aubrey, circumstances had
occurred which would render it in the last degree dangerous
to press that gentleman upon the subject. What
that was, which had happened, Mr. Gammon, as usual,
refused to state. This was a considerable source of vexation
to Mr. Quirk: but he had a far greater one, in the
decisive and final overthrow of his fondly-cherished hopes
concerning his daughter's alliance with Titmouse. The
paragraph in the <i>Aurora</i>, announcing Mr. Titmouse's engagement
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
to his brilliant relative, the Lady Cecilia, had
emanated from the pen of Mr. Gammon; who had had
several objects in view in giving early publicity to the
event. <i>Happening</i>(!) on the morning on which it appeared,
to be glancing over the fascinating columns of
the <i>Aurora</i> at a public office, (the paper taken in at their
own establishment being the <i>Morning Growl</i>,) he made a
point of purchasing that day's <i>Aurora</i>; and on returning
to Saffron Hill, he inquired whether Mr. Quirk were at
home. Hearing that he was sitting alone, in his room&mdash;in
rushed Mr. Gammon, breathless with surprise and
haste, and plucking the newspaper out of his pocket,&mdash;"By
Heavens, Mr. Quirk!"&mdash;he almost gasped as he
doubled down the paper to the place where stood the
announcement in question, and put it into Mr. Quirk's
hands,&mdash;"this young fellow's given you the slip, after
all! See!&mdash;The moment that my back is turned"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Quirk having, with a little trepidation, adjusted his
spectacles, perused the paragraph with a somewhat flushed
face. He had, in fact, for some time had grievous misgivings
on the subject of his chance of becoming the father-in-law
of his distinguished client, Mr. Titmouse; but now
his faintest glimmering of hope was suddenly and completely
extinguished, and the old gentleman felt quite
desolate. He looked up, as soon as he had finished reading,
and gazed ruefully at his indignant and sympathizing
companion.</p>

<p>"It seems all up, Gammon, certainly&mdash;don't it?" said
he, faintly, with a flustered air.</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear Mr. Quirk, it does! You have
my sincerest"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now comes t'other end of the thing, Gammon! You
know every promise of marriage has two ends&mdash;one joins
the heart, and t'other the pocket; <i>out</i> heart, <i>in</i> pocket&mdash;so
<i>have at him</i>, Gammon&mdash;have at him, by Jove!"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
He rose up and rubbed his hands as he stood before the
fire. "Breach of promise&mdash;thundering damages&mdash;devilish
deep purse&mdash;special jury&mdash;broken heart, and all that!
I wish he'd written her&mdash;by the way&mdash;more letters!
Adad, I'll have a shot at him by next assizes&mdash;a
writ on the file this very day! What d'ye think on't,
friend Gammon, between ourselves?" quoth Mr. Quirk,
heatedly.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear sir&mdash;to tell you the truth&mdash;aren't
you really well out of it? He's a miserable little upstart&mdash;he'd
have made a wretched husband for so superior a
girl as Miss Quirk."</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;ay! ay! She <i>is</i> a good girl, Gammon&mdash;there
you're right; would have made the best of wives&mdash;my
eyes, (between ourselves!) how that'll go to the jury!
Gad, I fancy I see'em&mdash;perhaps all of'em daughters
of their own."</p>

<p>"Looking at the thing calmly, Mr. Quirk," said Gammon,
gravely&mdash;apprehensive of Mr. Quirk's carrying too
far so very absurd an affair&mdash;"where's the <i>evidence</i> of the
promise?&mdash;Because, you know, there's certainly <i>something</i>
depends on that&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Evidence? Deuce take you, Gammon! where are
your wits? Evidence? Lots&mdash;lots of it! A'n't there
I&mdash;her father? A'n't I a competent<a name="FNanchor_31_35" id="FNanchor_31_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_35" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> witness? Wait
and see old Caleb Quirk get into the box. I'll settle his
hash in half a minute."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you're believed, perhaps."</p>

<p>"<i>Believe</i> be&mdash;&mdash;! Who's to be believed, if her own
father isn't?"</p>

<p>"Why, you may be too much swayed by your own
feelings!"</p>

<p>"<i>Feelings</i> be&mdash;&mdash;! It's past all that; he has none&mdash;so
he must pay, for he <i>has</i> cash! He ought to be made
an example of!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span></p>

<p>"Still, to come to the point, Mr. Quirk, I vow it quite
<i>teases</i> me&mdash;this matter of the evidence"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Evidence? Why, Lord bless my soul, Gammon,"
quoth Quirk, testily, "haven't <i>you</i> had your eyes and
ears open all this while? Gad, what a crack witness
you'd make! A man of your&mdash;your intellect&mdash;serve
a friend at a pinch&mdash;and in a matter about his daughter?
Ah, how often you've seen'em together&mdash;walking,
talking, laughing, dancing, riding&mdash;writ in her album&mdash;made
her presents, and she him. <i>Evidence?</i> Oceans of
it, and to spare! Secure Subtle&mdash;and I wouldn't take
£5,000 for my verdict!"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Mr. Quirk," said Gammon, very seriously&mdash;"though
I've striven my utmost these six months
to bring it about, the artful little scamp has never given
me the least thing that I could lay hold of, and <i>swear</i> to."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll <i>recollect</i> enough, in due time, friend Gammon,
if you'll only turn your attention to it; and if
you'll bear in mind it's life and death to my poor girl.
Oh Lord! I must get my sister to break it to her, and
I'll send sealed instructions to Mr. &mdash;&mdash; Weasel, shall we
say? or Lynx? ay, Lynx; for he'll then have to fight for
his own pleadings; and can't turn round at the trial and
say, 'this is not right,' and 'that's wrong,' and, '<i>why</i>
didn't you have such and such evidence?' Lynx is the
man; and I'll lay the venue in Yorkshire, for Titmouse
is devilish disliked down there; and a special jury will be
only too glad to give him a desperate slap in the chops!
We'll lay the damages at twenty thousand pounds! Ah,
ha! I'll teach the young villain to break the hearts of
an old man and his daughter. But, egad," he pulled out
his watch, "half-past two; and Nicky Crowbar sure to be
put up at three! By Jove! it won't do to be out of the
way; he's head of the gang, and they always come down
very liberally when they're in trouble. Snap! Amminadab!
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
hollo! who's there? Drat them all, why don't
they speak?" The old gentleman was soon, however, attended
to.</p>

<p>"Are they here?" he inquired, as Mr. Amminadab
entered.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, all three; and the coach is at the door, too.
Nicky Crowbar's to be up at three, sir"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;I know&mdash;I'm ready," replied Mr. Quirk,
who was presently seated in the coach with three gentlemen,
to whom he minutely explained the person of
Mr. Nicky Crowbar, and the place at which it was quite
certain that Mr. Crowbar could <i>not</i> have been at half-past
eleven o'clock on Tuesday night the 9th of July, seeing
that it did so happen that at that precise time he was
elsewhere, in company with these very three gentlemen&mdash;to
wit, at Chelsea, and <i>not at Clapham</i>! In short,
this was a first-rate <small>ALIBI</small>.</p>

<p>Though Mr. Gammon thus sympathized with one of
the gentle beings who had been "rifled of all their sweetness,"
I grieve to say that the other, Miss Tag-rag, never
occupied his thoughts for one moment. He neither knew
nor cared whether or not she was apprised of the destruction
of all <i>her</i> fond hopes, by the paragraph which had
appeared in the <i>Aurora</i>. He felt, in fact, that he had
really done enough, on the part of Mr. Titmouse, for his
early friend and patron, Mr. Tag-rag, on whom the stream
of fortune had set in strong and steady; and, in short,
Mr. Gammon knew that Mr. Tag-rag had received a substantial
memento of his connection with Tittlebat Titmouse.
How truly disinterested a man was Mr. Gammon
towards all with whom he came in contact! What had
he not done, as I have been saying, for the Tag-rags?
What for Mr. Titmouse? What for the Earl of Dreddlington?
What for Mr. Quirk, and even Snap? As for
Mr. Quirk, had he not been put in possession of his long-coveted
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
bond for £10,000? of which, by the way, he
allotted £1,000 only to the man&mdash;Mr. Gammon&mdash;by
whose unwearying exertions and consummate ability he
had obtained so splendid a prize, and £300 to Mr. Snap!
Then, had not Mr. Quirk also been paid his bill against
Titmouse of £5,000 and upwards, and £2,500 by Mr.
Aubrey? And, governed by the articles of their partnership,
what a <i>lion's half</i> of this spoil had not been appropriated
to the respectable old head of the firm? Mr.
Gammon did undoubtedly complain indignantly of the
trifling portion allotted to him, but he was encountered by
such a desperate pertinacity on the part of Mr. Quirk as
baffled him entirely, and caused him to abandon his further
claim in disgust and despair. Thus, the £20,000
obtained by Mr. Titmouse, on mortgage of the Yatton
property, was reduced at once to the sum of £5,000;&mdash;but
out of this handsome balance had yet to come, first,
£800, with interest, due to Mr. Quirk for subsistence-money
advanced to Titmouse; secondly, £500 due to
Mr. Snap, for moneys alleged to have been also lent by
him to his friend Titmouse at different times, in the manner
which has been already explained to the reader&mdash;Snap's
demand for repayment being accompanied by <i>verbatim</i>
copies&mdash;such he stated them to be&mdash;of between
forty and fifty memoranda&mdash;many of them in pencil&mdash;notes
of hand, receipts, I. O. U.'s, &amp;c., in whose handwriting
the figures representing <i>the sums lent</i>, and the
times when, could not be ascertained, and did not signify:
it being, in point of law, good <i>primâ facie</i> evidence for
Snap, in the event of a trial, simply to produce the
documents and prove the signature of his friend Mr. Titmouse.<a name="FNanchor_32_36" id="FNanchor_32_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_36" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
That gentleman discharged a volley of imprecations
at Snap's head, on receiving this unexpected
claim, and referred it to Mr. Gammon; who, after subjecting
it to a <i>bonâ fide</i> and very rigorous examination,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
found it in vain to attempt to resist, or even diminish
it; such perfect method and accuracy had Snap observed
in his accounts, that they secured him a clear gain of
£350; the difference between that sum and £500, being
the amount actually and <i>bonâ fide</i> advanced by him to
Titmouse. Deducting, therefore, £1,300, (the amount of
the two minor demands of £800 and £500 above specified,)
there remained to Mr. Titmouse out of the £20,000
the sum of £3,700; and he ought to have been thankful;
for he <i>might</i> have got <i>nothing</i>&mdash;or even have been
brought in debtor to Messrs. Quirk, Gammon, and Snap.
I say that Mr. Gammon would seem, from the above
statement of accounts, not to have been dealt with in
any degree adequately to his merits. He felt such to be
his case; but soon reconciled himself to it, occupied as he
was with arduous and extensive speculations, amid all
the complication of which he never for a moment lost
sight of one object, viz.&mdash;<i>himself</i>. His schemes were
boldly conceived, and he went about the accomplishment
of them with equal patience and sagacity. Almost everything
was at present going on as he could have wished.
He had contrived to place himself in a very convenient
fast-and-loose sort of position with reference to his fellow-partners&mdash;one
which admitted of his easily disengaging
himself from them, whenever the proper time
should have arrived for taking such a step. He was absolute
and paramount over Titmouse, and could always
secure his instant submission, by virtue of the fearful and
mysterious talisman which he occasionally flashed before
his startled eyes. He had acquired great influence, also,
over the Earl of Dreddlington&mdash;an influence which was
constantly on the increase; and had seen come to pass
an event which he judged to be of great importance to
him&mdash;namely, the engagement between Titmouse and
the Lady Cecilia.  Yet was there one object which he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
had proposed to himself as incalculably valuable and
supremely desirable&mdash;as the consummation of all his
designs and wishes; I mean the obtaining the hand of
Miss Aubrey&mdash;and in which he had yet a fearful misgiving
of failure. But he was a man whose courage rose
with every obstacle; and he fixedly resolved within himself,
to succeed, at any cost. 'Twas not alone his exquisite appreciation
of her personal beauty, her grace, her accomplishments,
her lovely temper, her lofty spirit, her high
birth&mdash;objects all of them dazzling enough to a man of
such a powerful and ambitious mind, and placed in such
circumstances in life as Gammon. There were certain
other considerations, intimately involved in all his calculations,
which&mdash;as may possibly become apparent hereafter&mdash;rendered
success in this affair a matter of vital consequence&mdash;nay,
indispensable. Knowing, as I do, what
had passed at different times between that proud and
determined girl and her constant and enthusiastic lover,
Mr. Delamere, I am as certain as a man can be of anything
that has not actually happened, that, though she
may possibly not be fated to become Mrs. Delamere, she
will certainly <small>NEVER</small> become&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Gammon</span>!&mdash;Loving
Kate as I do, and being thoroughly acquainted with Gammon,
I feel deep interest in his movements, and am
watching them with great apprehension:&mdash;she, lovely,
innocent, unsuspicious; he, subtle, selfish, unscrupulous,
desperate! And he has great power in his hands: is he
not silently surrounding his destined prey with unperceived,
but apparently inextricable meshes? God guard
thee, my Kate, and reward thy noble devotion to thy
brother and his fallen fortunes! Do we chide thee for
clinging to them with fond tenacity in their extremity,
when thou art daily importuned to enter into that station
which thou wouldst so adorn?</p>

<p>Gammon's reception by the Aubreys, in Vivian
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
Street&mdash;kind and courteous though it had surely been&mdash;had
ever since rankled in his heart. Their abstaining from
a request to him to prolong his stay, or to renew his visit,
he had noted at the time, and had ever since reflected
upon it with pique and discouragement. Nevertheless,
he was resolved at all hazards to become at least an occasional
visitor in Vivian Street. When a fortnight had
elapsed without any further intimation to Mr. Aubrey
concerning the dreaded balance due to the firm, Gammon
ventured to call upon him, for the purpose of assuring
Mr. Aubrey that it was no mere temporary lull; that
he might divest his mind of all uneasiness on the subject;
and of asking whether he (Gammon) had not told Mr.
Aubrey truly that he both could and would restrain the
hand of Mr. Quirk. Could Mr. Aubrey be otherwise than
grateful for such active, effectual, and manifestly disinterested
kindness? Again Gammon made his appearance at
Mrs. Aubrey's tea-table&mdash;and was again received with all
the sweetness and frankness of manner which he had formerly
experienced from her and Miss Aubrey. Again he
called, on some adroit pretext or another&mdash;and once heard
Miss Aubrey's rich voice and exquisite performance on the
piano. He became subject to emotions and impulses of
such a sort as he had never before experienced; yet, whenever
he retired from their fascinating society, he was conscious
of an aching void, as it were, within&mdash;he perceived
the absence of all sympathy towards him; he felt <i>indignant</i>&mdash;but
that did not quench the ardor of his aspirations.
'Tis hardly necessary to say, that on every occasion,
Gammon effectually concealed the profound and agitating
feelings which the sight of Miss Aubrey called forth in
him; and what a tax was this upon his powers of self-control!
How he laid himself out to amuse and interest
them all! With what racy humor would he describe the
vulgar absurdities of Titmouse&mdash;the stately eccentricities
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
of the Dreddlingtons! With what eager and breathless
interest was he listened to! Few men could make
themselves more completely agreeable than Gammon; and
the ladies really took pleasure in his society; Kate being,
all the while, about as far from any notion of the real state
of his feelings, as is my fair reader of what is at this moment
going on in the dog-star. Her reserve towards him
sensibly lessened; why, indeed, should she feel it, towards
one of whom Dr. Tatham spoke so highly, and who appeared
to justify his eulogium? Moreover, Mr. Gammon
took special care to speak in the most unreserved and unqualified
manner of the mean and mercenary character of
Mr. Quirk&mdash;of the miserable style of business in which
he, Mr. Gammon, was compelled, for only a short time
longer, he trusted, to participate, and which was really
revolting to his own feelings. He did his best, in short,
to cause himself to appear a sensitive and high-minded
man, whose unhappy fate it had been to be yoked with
those who were the reverse. Mr. Aubrey regarded him
from time to time with silent anxiety and interest, as one
who had it in his power, at any instant he might choose,
to cause the suspended sword to fall upon him; at whose
will and pleasure he continued in the enjoyment of his
present domestic happiness, instead of being incarcerated
in prison; but who had hitherto evinced a disposition of
signal forbearance, sincere good-nature, and disinterestedness.
They often used to speak of him, and compare the
impression which his person and conduct had produced in
their minds; and in two points they agreed&mdash;that he
certainly exhibited anxiety to render himself agreeable;
and that there was a certain <i>something</i> about his eye which
none of them liked. It seemed as though he had in a
manner two natures; and that one of them was watching
the effect of the efforts made by the other to beguile!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>While, however, the Fates thus seemed to frown upon
the aspiring attempts of Gammon towards Miss Aubrey,
they smiled benignantly enough upon Titmouse, and his
suit with the Lady Cecilia. The first shock over&mdash;which
no lively sensibilities or strong feelings of her Ladyship
tended to protract, she began to get familiar with the
person, manners, and character of her future lord, and
in a measure reconciled to her fate. "When people understand
that they <i>must</i> live together," said a very great
man, "they learn to soften, by mutual accommodation,
that yoke which they know that they cannot shake off;
they become good husbands and wives, from the necessity
of remaining husbands and wives, for necessity is
a powerful master in teaching the duties which it imposes."<a name="FNanchor_33_37" id="FNanchor_33_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_37" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
The serene intelligence of Lady Cecilia having
satisfied her that "<small>IT WAS HER FATE</small>" to be married to
Titmouse, she resigned herself to it tranquilly, calling in
to her assistance divers co-operative reasons for the step
which she had agreed to take. She could thereby accomplish
at all events one darling object of her papa's&mdash;the
reunion of the long and unhappily-severed family interests.
Then Yatton was certainly a delightful estate to
be mistress of&mdash;a charming residence, and one which she
might in all probability calculate on having pretty nearly
to herself. The rent-roll was large and unencumbered,
and would admit of a handsome jointure. On her accession
to her own independent rank, the odious name of
Titmouse would disappear in the noble one of Lady Drelincourt,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
peeress in her own right, and representative of
the oldest barony in the kingdom. Her husband would
then become a mere cipher&mdash;no one would ever hear of
him, or inquire after him, or think or care about him&mdash;a
mere mote in the sunbeam of her own splendor. But,
above all, thank Heaven! there were many ways in which
a <i>separation</i> might be brought about&mdash;never mind how
soon after marriage: and a separation was becoming almost
a matter of course, implying nothing derogatory to
the character, or lessening to the personal consequence of
the lady&mdash;who indeed was almost, as of course, recognized
as an object of sympathy, rather than of suspicion
or scorn. These were powerful forces, all impelling her in
one direction&mdash;and irresistibly. How could it be otherwise
with one like <i>her</i>&mdash;a mere creature of circumstance?
Notwithstanding all this, however, there were occasions
when Titmouse was presented to her in a somewhat startling
and sickening aspect. It sometimes almost choked
her to see him&mdash;ridiculous object!&mdash;in the company
of gentlemen&mdash;to witness their treatment of him, and
then reflect that he was about to become her&mdash;lord and
master. One day, for instance, she accompanied the earl
in the carriage to witness the hounds throw off, not far
from Yatton, and where a very brilliant field was expected.
There were, in fact, about two hundred of the leading
gentlemen of the county assembled&mdash;and, dear reader,
do try to picture to yourself the figure which Titmouse
must have presented among them&mdash;his quizzing-glass
screwed into his eye, and clad in his little pink and leathers!&mdash;What
a <i>seat</i> was his! How many significant and
scornful smiles, and winks, and shrugs of the shoulders
did his appearance occasion among his bold and high-bred
companions! And only about four or five minutes after
they had "gone away"&mdash;on the occasion in question,
this unhappy little sinner was thoroughly found out by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
the noble animal he rode; and who equally well knew
<i>his own business</i>, and what he had <i>on</i>! In trying to take
a dwarf wall, on the opposite side of an old green horsepond
by the road-side, he urged his horse with that weak
and indecisive impulse which only disgusted him; so he
suddenly drew back at the margin of the pond&mdash;and over
head and heels flew Titmouse, descending plump on his
head into the deep mud, where he remained for a moment
or two, up to his shoulders, his little legs kicking about
in the air&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who's that?" cried one&mdash;and another&mdash;and another&mdash;without
stopping, any more than the Life Guards would
have stopped for a sudden individual casualty in the midst
of their tremendous charge at Waterloo&mdash;till the very
last of them, who happened to be no less a person than
Lord De la Zouch, seeing, as he came up, the desperate
position of the fallen rider, reined up, dismounted, and
with much effort and inconvenience aided in extricating
Titmouse from his fearful yet ludicrous position&mdash;and
thus fortunately preserved to society one of its brightest
ornaments. As soon as he was safe&mdash;-a dismal spectacle to
gods and men&mdash;his preserver, not disposed, by discovering
who Titmouse was, to supererogatory courtesy, mounted
his horse, leaving Titmouse in the care of an old woman
whose cottage was not far off, and where Titmouse, having
had a good deal of the filth detached from him, remounted
his horse and turned its head homewards&mdash;heartily
disposed, had he but <i>dared</i>, cruelly to spur, and
kick, and flog it; and in this pickle&mdash;stupid, and sullen,
and crestfallen&mdash;he was overtaken and recognized
by Lord Dreddlington and Lady Cecilia, returning from
the field!</p>

<p>This was her future husband&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then again&mdash;poor Lady Cecilia!&mdash;what thought you
of the following, which was one of the letters he addressed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
to you?&mdash;Well might Miss Aubrey exclaim, "how I
should like to see their correspondence!"</p>

<p>When poor Lady Cecilia received this exquisite epistle,
and had read over only half a dozen lines of it, she
flung it on the floor; threw herself down on the sofa
in her dressing-room; and remained silent and motionless
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
for more than an hour. When she heard Miss Macspleuchan
knock at her door for admittance, Lady Cecilia
started up, snatched the letter from the floor, and thrust
it into her dressing-case, before admitting her "humble
companion."</p>

<p>A succession of such letters as the above might have
had the effect upon Lady Cecilia's "<i>attachment</i>" to Titmouse,
which the repeated affusion of cold water would
have upon the thermometer; but the crack-brained
Fates still favored Mr. Titmouse, by presently investing
him with a character, and placing him in a position, calculated
to give him personal dignity, and thereby redeem
and elevate him in the estimation of his fastidious and
lofty mistress&mdash;I mean that of candidate for a seat in
Parliament&mdash;for the representation of a borough in which
he had a commanding influence:&mdash;but this brings me to
topics which must not be lightly handled.</p>

<p>After a national commotion commensurate with the
magnitude of the boon which had been sought for, the
great <span class="smcap">Bill for Giving Everybody Everything</span> had passed
into a law, and the people were frantic with joy. Its
blooming first fruits were of a sort calculated to satisfy
the public expectation, viz.&mdash;two or three earls were
turned into marquises, and one or two marquises into
dukes, and deservedly; for these great men had far higher
titles to the gratitude and admiration of the country, in
exacting this second Magna Charta from King &mdash;&mdash;, than
the stern old barons in extorting the first from King John&mdash;namely,
they parted with vast substantial political
power, for only a nominal <i>quid pro quo</i>, in the shape of a
bit of ribbon or a strawberry leaf. Its next immediate
effect was to cleanse the Augean stable of the House of
Commons, by opening upon it the floodgates of popular
will and popular opinion; and having utterly expelled the
herd of ignorant and mercenary wretches which had so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
long occupied and defiled it, their places were to be supplied
by a band of patriots and statesmen, as gifted as
disinterested&mdash;the people's own enlightened, unbiased,
and deliberate choice. Once put the government of the
country&mdash;it was said&mdash;the administration of affairs&mdash;into
hands such as these, and the inevitable result would
be, the immediate regeneration of society, and the securing
the greatest happiness to the greatest number. It
was fearfully apparent that, under the old system, we had
sunk into irredeemable contempt abroad, and were on the
very verge of ruin and anarchy at home. So blessedly
true is it, that when things come to the worst, they begin
to mend! In short, the enlightened and enlarged constituencies
began forthwith to look out for fit objects of
their choice&mdash;for the best men; men of independent fortune;
of deep stake in the welfare of the country; of
spotless private and consistent public character; who,
having had adequate leisure, opportunity, inclination, and
capacity, had fitted themselves to undertake, with advantage
to the nation, the grave responsibilities of statesmen
and legislators. Such candidates, therefore, as Mr. Tittlebat
Titmouse, became naturally in universal request; and
the consequence was, such a prodigious flight of Titmice
into the House of Commons&mdash;but whither am I wandering?
I have to do with only one little borough&mdash;that of
Yatton in Yorkshire. The Great Charter operated upon
it, by <i>first</i>, in a manner, <i>amputating</i> it of one of its members;
<i>secondly</i>, extending its boundary&mdash;Grilston, and
one or two of the adjacent places, being incorporated into
the new borough; <i>thirdly</i>, by the introduction of the new
qualification of voters. I have ascertained from a very
high quarter&mdash;in fact, from a Cabinet Minister, <i>since deceased</i><a name="FNanchor_34_38" id="FNanchor_34_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_38" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;a
curious and important fact; viz. that had
Mr. Titmouse failed in recovering the Yatton property, or
been of different political opinions, in either of these cases,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
the little borough of Yatton was doomed to utter extinction:
a circumstance which shows the signal vigilance, the
accurate and comprehensive knowledge of local interest
and capabilities, evinced by those great and good men
who were remodelling the representation of the country.
How little did my hero suspect that his political opinions,
as newly-installed owner of Yatton, formed a topic of anxious
discussion at more than one Cabinet council, previous
to the passing of the Great Bill! Upon such considerations
did it&mdash;in fact&mdash;depend whether Yatton should
be at once deposited in the sepulchre of "<i>Schedule A</i>;" or
added to the dismal rank of surviving, but <i>maimed</i> ones
in "<i>Schedule B.</i>" As its boundary was extended, so the
constituency of Yatton was, as I have said, enlarged; the
invaluable elective franchise being wisely given to those
most in need of the advantages it could <i>immediately</i> procure;
and the fleeting nature of whose interest naturally
enhanced their desire to consult the welfare of those
who had a permanent and deep stake in its prosperity.
Though, however, the change effected by the new act had
so considerably added to the roll of electors, it had not
given ground for serious apprehension as to the security
of the seat of the owner of the Yatton property. After a
very long and private interview between Gammon and
Titmouse, in which something transpired which may be
referred to hereafter, it was agreed that&mdash;(the New
Writs having been issued within one week after the
calmed and sobered new constituencies had been organized&mdash;which
organization, again, had been wisely effected
within a week or two after the passing of the act which
had created them)&mdash;Mr. Titmouse should instantly scare
away all competition, by announcing his determination to
start for the borough. As soon as this was known, a deputation
from a club of the new electors in Grilston
waited upon Mr. Titmouse&mdash;to propose the pecuniary
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
terms on which their support was to be obtained. Hereat
he was somewhat startled&mdash;but Gammon saw in it the
legitimate working of the new system; and&mdash;nothing
was ever better managed!&mdash;nobody was in any mischievous
secret&mdash;neither party compromised; and yet the
happy result was&mdash;that <i>one hundred and nine</i> votes were
in a trice secured in Grilston alone for Mr. Titmouse.
Then Gammon appointed Messrs. Bloodsuck and Son the
local agents of Titmouse; for whom he wrote an address
to the electors&mdash;and, Titmouse promising to have it
printed forthwith, Mr. Gammon returned to town for a
day or two. Nothing could have been more skilful than
the document which he had prepared&mdash;at once terse,
comprehensive, and showy; meaning everything, or nothing&mdash;(<i>dolosus
semper versatur in generalibus</i>, was an observation
of Lord Coke's on which Gammon had kept his
eye fixed in drawing up his "Address.") Yet it came to
pass, that on the evening of the day of Gammon's departure,
a Mr. Phelim O'Doodle, a splendid billiard-player, (in
fact he had commenced life in the capacity of <i>marker</i> to a
billiard-table near Leicester Square,) and also one of the
first members returned&mdash;only a few days before&mdash;for an
Irish borough in the Liberal interest, chanced to take
Yatton in his way to Scotland, (where he was going to
officiate professionally at a grand match at billiards, at
the house of an early patron, Sir Archibald M'Cannon,)
from London; and being intimate with Mr. Titmouse,
from whom (to conceal nothing from the reader) he had
borrowed a little money a few months before, to enable
him to present himself to his intelligent and enthusiastic
constituency&mdash;they sat down to canvass the merits of
the Address which the astute but <i>absent</i> Gammon had
prepared for Titmouse. Mr. O'Doodle pronounced it
"divilish tame, and <i>maiger</i>;" comparing it to toddy,
with the <i>whiskey omitted</i>: and availing himself of Gammon's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
draft as far as he approved of it, he drew up the
following, which put Titmouse into an ecstasy; and he
sent it off the very next morning for insertion in the
<i>Yorkshire Stingo</i>. Here is an exact copy of that judicious
and able performance&mdash;which I must own I consider
quite a model in its way.</p>

<blockquote>

<div align="left"> "<i>To the worthy and independent Electors of Yatton.</i> </div>
<br />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;His Majesty having been pleased to dissolve
the late Parliament, under very remarkable and exciting
circumstances, and, in the midst of the transports of enthusiasm
arising out of the passing of that second Great Charter of
our Liberties, <i>the Act for Giving Everybody Everything</i>, with
kindly wisdom, to call upon you to exercise immediately the
high and glorious privilege of choosing your representative in
the New Parliament, I beg leave to announce myself as a candidate
for that distinguished honor. Gentlemen, long before
I succeeded in establishing my right to reside among you in
my present capacity, I felt a deep interest in the welfare of
the tenants of the property, and especially of those residing
in the parts adjacent, and who are now so happily introduced
into the constituency of this ancient and loyal borough. I
trust that the circumstance of my ancestors having resided for
ages within it, will not indispose you to a favorable reception
of their descendant and representative. Gentlemen, my political
opinions are those which led to the passing of the Great
Measure I have alluded to, and which are bound up in it.
Without going into details, which are too multifarious for the
limits of such an Address as the present, let me assure you,
that though firmly resolved to uphold the agricultural interests
of this great country, I am equally anxious to sustain the
commercial and manufacturing interests; and whenever they
are unhappily in fatal conflict with each other, I shall be found
at my post, zealously supporting <i>both</i>, to the utmost of my
ability. Though a sincere and firm member and friend of
the Established Church, I am not insensible to the fearful
abuses which at present prevail in it; particularly in its revenues,
which I am disposed to lessen and equalize&mdash;devoting
the surplus capital to useful purposes connected with the
State, from which she derived them, as history testifies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am bent upon securing the utmost possible latitude to every
species of Dissent. In fact, I greatly doubt whether any form
of religion ought to be '<i>established</i>' in a free country. While
I am resolved to uphold Protestantism, I think I best do so,
by seeking to remove all restrictions from the Catholics, who,
I am persuaded, will sacredly abstain from endeavoring to
promote their own interests at the expense of ours. The infallible
page of history establishes their humility, meekness,
and moderation. Gentlemen, depend upon it, the established
religion is most likely to flourish when surrounded by danger,
and threatened by persecution; it has an inherent vitality
which will defy, in the long run, all competition, and there
<i>must</i> be competition, or there can be no triumph. Gentlemen,
I am for Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform, which are in fact
the Three Polar Stars of my political conduct. I am an advocate
for quarterly Parliaments, convinced that we cannot too
often be summoned to give an account of our stewardship&mdash;and
that the frequency of elections will occasion a wholesome
agitation, and stimulus to trade. I am for extending the elective
franchise to all, except those who are actually the inmates
of a prison or a poor-house on the day of election; and for
affording to electors the inviolable secrecy and protection of
the Ballot. I am an uncompromising advocate of civil and
religious liberty all over the globe; and, in short, of giving
the greatest happiness to the greatest number. Gentlemen,
before concluding, I wish to state explicitly, as the result of
long and deep inquiry and reflection, that I am of opinion that
every constituency is entitled, nay, bound, to exact from a candidate
for its suffrages the most strict and minute pledges as to
his future conduct in Parliament, in every matter, great or
small, that can come before it; in order to prevent his judgment
being influenced and warped by the dangerous sophistries
and fallacies which are broached in Parliament, and protect
his integrity from the base, sinister, and corrupt influences
which are invariably brought to bear on public men. I am
ready, therefore, to pledge myself to anything that may be
required of me by any elector who may honor me with his support.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Gentlemen, such are my political principles, and I
humbly hope that they will prove to be those of the electors
of this ancient and loyal borough, so as to warrant the legislature
in having preserved it in existence, amid the wholesale
havoc which it has just made in property of this description.
Though it is not probable that we shall be harassed by a contest,
I shall make a point of waiting upon you all personally,
and humbly answering all questions that may be put to me:
and should I be returned, rely upon it, that I will never give
you occasion to regret your display of so signal an evidence of
your confidence in me.&mdash;I have the honor to be, Gentlemen,

<p>"Upon my soul, if that don't carry the election hollow,"
said Mr. O'Doodle, laying down his pen, and mixing
himself a fresh tumbler of half-and-half brandy and
water, "you may call me bog-trotter to the end of my
days, and be &mdash;&mdash; to me!"!!!</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;a&mdash;ya&mdash;as! 'pon my life it's quite a superior
article, and no mistake"&mdash;quoth Titmouse; "but&mdash;eh?
d'ye think they'll ever believe I writ it all?
Egad, my fine fellow, to compose a piece of composition
like that, by Jove!&mdash;requires&mdash;and besides, suppose
those dem fellows begin asking me all sorts of questions
and thingembobs, eh? You <i>couldn't</i> stay and go about
with one a bit? Eh, Phelim?"</p>

<p>"Fait, Titty, an' it's mighty little awake to the way
of <i>doing business</i>, that ye are! ah, ha! Murder and
thieves! what does it signify what you choose to say or
write to them? they're only <i>pisintry</i>: and&mdash;the real
point to be looked at is this&mdash;all those that you can
<i>command</i>&mdash;d'ye see&mdash;of course you will, or send 'em
to the right about; and those that you can't&mdash;that's
the <i>new</i> blackguards round about&mdash;<i>buy</i>, if it's necessary,
fait!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that's <i>done</i>!&mdash;It <i>is</i>, 'pon my soul!" whispered
Titmouse.</p>

<p>"Oh? Is it in earnest you are? Then you're M. P.
for the borough; and on the strength of it, I'll replenish!"
and so he did, Titmouse following his example;
and in a pretty state were they, some hour or two afterwards,
conducted to their apartments.</p>

<p>It is difficult to describe the rage of Gammon on seeing
the Address which had been substituted for that
which he had prepared, with so much caution and tact:
but the thing was done, and he was obliged to submit.
The Address duly appeared in the <i>Yorkshire Stingo</i>. It
was also placarded liberally all over the borough, and
distributed about, exciting a good deal of interest, and
also much approbation among the new electors. It was
thought, however, that it was a piece of supererogation,
inasmuch as there could be no possible doubt that Mr.
Titmouse would <i>walk over the course</i>.</p>

<p>In this, however, it presently proved that the <i>quidnuncs</i>
of Yatton were terribly mistaken. A copy of the
<i>Yorkshire Stingo</i>, containing the foregoing "Address,"
was sent, on the day of its publication, by Dr. Tatham
to Mr. Aubrey, who had read it aloud, with feelings of
mingled sorrow and contempt, on the evening of its arrival,
in the presence of Mrs. Aubrey, Miss Aubrey, and
also of one who was by no means an unfrequent visitor,
Mr. Delamere. The Aubreys were sad enough; and he
endeavored to dissipate the gloom which hung over them,
by ridiculing, very bitterly and humorously, the pretensions
of the would-be member for Yatton&mdash;the presumed
writer (who, however, Kate protested, without giving her
reasons, could never have been Mr. Titmouse) of the precious
"Address." He partially succeeded. Both Aubrey
and he laughed heartily as they went more deliberately
over it; but Kate and Mrs. Aubrey spoke very gravely
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
and indignantly about that part of it which related to
the Established Church and the Protestant Religion.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, dear!" quoth Kate at length, with a sudden
burst of impetuosity, after a considerable and rather
melancholy pause in the conversation; "only to think
that such an odious little wretch is to represent the dear
old&mdash;&mdash;What would I not give to see him defeated!"</p>

<p>"Pho, Kate," replied her brother, rather sadly, "who
is there to oppose him? Pickering told me, you know,
that he should not go into the House again; and even if
he felt disposed to contest Yatton, what chance could he
have against Mr. Titmouse's influence?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure all the old tenants hate the little monkey,
to a man&mdash;and that <i>you</i> know, Charles, right
well!"</p>

<p>"That may be, Kate, but they must vote for him, or
be turned out of"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I've no <i>patience</i>, Charles, to hear of such
things!" interrupted his sister, with not a little petulance
in her manner.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say, that you should like to see a
rival start to contest your dear old borough with Mr.
Titmouse?" inquired Mr. Delamere, who had been listening
to the foregoing brief colloquy in silence, his eyes
fixed with eager delight on the animated and beautiful
countenance of Miss Aubrey.</p>

<p>"<i>Indeed</i> I should, Mr. Delamere," cried Kate, eagerly&mdash;"I
would give five guineas, if I had it"&mdash;adding,
however, with a sudden sigh, looking at her brother;
"but&mdash;heigh-ho!&mdash;as Charles says, how absurd it is
to fret one's self about it&mdash;about a thing we can't help&mdash;and&mdash;a
place one has no longer&mdash;alas!&mdash;any concern
with!" As she said this, her voice fell a little, and
her eyes filled with tears. But her little sally had been attended
with consequences she never could have dreamed of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Delamere took leave of them shortly afterwards,
without communicating a word of any intentions he might
have conceived upon the subject to any of them. But
the first place he went to, in the morning, was a great
banker's, who had been appointed the principal acting
executor of the Marquis of Fallowfield, a very recently
deceased uncle of Delamere's, to whom his Lordship had
left a legacy of £3,000; and 'twas to get at this same
legacy that was the object of Delamere's visit to Sir
Omnium Bullion's. For some time the worthy baronet&mdash;who
had not then even proved the will&mdash;would not
listen to the entreaties of the eager young legatee: but
the moment that he heard of the purpose for which it
was wanted, Sir Omnium being a very fierce Tory, and
who had <i>lost</i> his own snug borough by the Bill for <i>Giving
Everybody Everything</i>, instantly relented. "There, my
fine fellow, that's a piece of pluck I vastly admire! Sign
<i>that</i>," said Sir Omnium, tossing to him an "I. O. U.
£3,000," and drawing him a check for the amount: wishing
him, with all imaginable zeal and energy, good speed.
Delamere's excitement would not allow him to wait till
the evening, for the mail; so, within a couple of hours'
time of effecting this delightful arrangement with Sir
Omnium, he was seated in a post-chaise and four, rattling
at top-speed on his way to Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Sufficiently astonished were Lord and Lady De la
Zouch, when he presented himself to them at Fotheringham;
but infinitely more so, when he named the object
of his coming down, and with desperate entreaties besought
his father's sanction for the enterprise. 'Twas
very hard for Lord De la Zouch to deny anything to one
on whom he doted as he did upon this, his only child.
His Lordship, moreover, was one of the keenest politicians
living; and as for elections, he was an old campaigner,
and had stood several desperate contests, and spent immense
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
sums upon them. And here was his son, to use a
well-known phrase, indeed a <i>chip of the old block</i>!&mdash;Lord
De la Zouch, in short, really felt a secret pleasure in contemplating
the resemblance to his early self&mdash;and after
a little demur he began to give way. He shook his head,
however, discouragingly; spoke of Delamere's youth&mdash;barely
two-and-twenty; the certainty of defeat, and the
annoyance of being beaten by such a creature as Titmouse;
the suddenness and lateness of the move&mdash;and
so forth.</p>

<p>More and more impetuous, however, became his son.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, sir," said Lord De la Zouch, scarce
able to speak with the gravity he wished, "it strikes me
that this extraordinary, expensive, absurd, and hopeless
scheme of yours, is all the result of&mdash;eh? I see&mdash;I
understand! It's done to please&mdash;Come, now, be
frank, sir! how long, before you left town, had you seen
Miss"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I pledge my word, sir," replied Delamere, emphatically,
"that neither Miss Aubrey, nor Mr. nor Mrs. Aubrey&mdash;whom,
however, I certainly saw the very night
before I quitted town, and even conversed with on the
subject of Mr. Titmouse's Address&mdash;has interchanged one
syllable with me on the subject of my starting for the
borough; and I believe them to be at this moment as
ignorant of what I am about as you, sir, were, the moment
before you saw me here."</p>

<p>"It is enough," said his father, seriously, who knew
that his son, equally with himself, had a rigorous regard
for truth on all occasions, great and small&mdash;"and had it
even been otherwise, I&mdash;I&mdash;eh? I don't think there's
anything <i>very</i> monstrous in it!" He paused, and smiled
kindly at his son&mdash;and added, "Well&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;we
certainly shall be laughed at for our pains; it's really a
madcap sort of business, Geoffrey; but"&mdash;Lord De la
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
Zouch had given way&mdash;"I own that I should not like to
have been thwarted by <i>my</i> father on an occasion like the
present; so, let it be done, as you've set your heart upon
it. And," he added with a smile, "pray, Mr. Delamere,
have you considered what I shall have to pay for your
sport?"</p>

<p>"Not one penny, sir!" replied his son, with a certain
swell of manner.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" exclaimed his Lordship, briskly&mdash;"How's
that, sir?"</p>

<p>Then Delamere told him of what he had done; at which
Lord De la Zouch first looked serious, and then burst into
laughter at the eagerness of old Sir Omnium to aid the
affair. Lord De la Zouch well knew that the old baronet
was infinitely exasperated against those who had
robbed him of his borough! Never was "<i>Schedule A</i>"
mentioned in his presence without a kind of spasm passing
over his features! as though it were the burial-ground
where lay one long and fondly loved! "No, no," said
his Lordship, "that must not stand; I won't have <i>any</i>
risk of Sir Omnium's getting into a scrape, and shall
write off to request him to annul the transaction&mdash;with
many thanks for what he has done&mdash;and I'll try
whether I have credit enough with my bankers&mdash;eh,
Geoffrey?"</p>

<p>"You are very kind to me, sir, but really I would
rather"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pho, pho&mdash;let it be as I say; and now, go and dress
for dinner, and, after that, the sooner you get about <i>your</i>
'Address,' the better. Let me see a draft of it as soon
as it is finished. Let Mr. Parkinson be sent for immediately
from Grilston, to see how the land lies; and, in
short, if we <i>do</i> go into the thing, let us dash into it with
spirit&mdash;I'll write off and have down from town&mdash;a-hem!"
his Lordship suddenly paused&mdash;and then
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
added&mdash;"And hark 'ee, sir&mdash;as to that Address of yours, I'll
have no despicable trimming, and trying to catch votes
by vague and flattering"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Trust me, sir!" said Delamere, with a proud smile,
"mine shall be, at all events, a contrast to that of my
'<i>honorable opponent</i>.'"</p>

<p>"Go straight a-head, sir," continued Lord De la Zouch,
with a lofty and determined air; "nail your colors to the
mast. Speak out in a plain, manly way, so that no one
can misunderstand you. I'd rather a thousand times
over see you beaten out of the field&mdash;lose the election
like a gentleman&mdash;than win it by any sort of <i>trickery</i>,
especially as far as the profession of your political sentiments
and opinions is concerned. Bear yourself so, Geoffrey,
in this your maiden struggle, that when it is over,
you may be able to lay your hand on your heart, and say,
'I have <i>won</i> honorably'&mdash;or 'I have <i>lost</i> honorably.'
So long as you can feel and say <i>this</i>, laugh at election
bills&mdash;at the long faces of your friends&mdash;the exulting
faces of your enemies.&mdash;Will you bear all this in mind,
Geoffrey?"</p>

<p>"I will, I will, sir," replied his eager son; and added,
with an excited air, "won't it come on them like"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you hear that bell, sir?" said Lord De la Zouch,
laughing, and moving away. Delamere bowed, and with
a brisk step, a flushed cheek, and an elated air, betook
himself to his dressing-room, to prepare for dinner.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Mr. Parkinson made his appearance,
and to his infinite amazement was invested instantly with
the character of agent for Mr. Delamere, as candidate for
the borough! After he and the earl had heard the following
Address read by Delamere, they very heartily approved
of it. Mr. Parkinson took it home with him; it
was in the printer's hands that very night, and by seven
o'clock in the morning, was being stuck up plentifully
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
on all the walls in Grilston, and in fact, all over the
borough:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div align="left"> "<i>To the Independent Electors of the Borough of Yatton.</i></div>
<br />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>&mdash;I hope you will not consider me presumptuous,
in venturing to offer myself to your notice as a candidate
for the honor of representing you in Parliament. In point of
years, I am, I have reason to believe, even younger than the
gentleman whom I have come forward to oppose. But, indeed,
for the fact of his being personally a comparative stranger to
you, I should have paused long before contesting with him the
representation of a borough on which he has unquestionably
certain legitimate claims. The moment, however, that I had
read his Address, I resolved to come forward and oppose him.
Gentlemen, the chief ground on which I am induced to take
this step, is, that I disapprove of the tone and spirit of that
Address, and hold opinions entirely opposed to all those which
it expresses, and which I have no hesitation in saying I consider
to be unworthy of any one seeking so grave a trust as
that of representing you in Parliament. As for my own opinions,
they are in all essential respects identical with those of the
gentlemen who have, during a long series of years, represented
you, and especially with those of my highly honored and gifted
friend, Mr. Aubrey. Gentlemen, my own family is not unknown
to you, nor are the opinions and principles which for
centuries they have consistently supported, and which are also
mine.</p>

<p>"I am an affectionate and uncompromising friend of our
glorious and venerable Established Church, and of its union
with the State; which it is my inflexible determination to support
by every means in my power, as the most effectual mode
of securing civil and religious liberty. I am disposed to resist
any further concessions either to Roman Catholics or Dissenters,
because I think that they cannot be made safely or advantageously.
Gentlemen, there <i>is</i> a point at which toleration
becomes anarchy; and I am desirous to keep as far from that
point as possible.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I earnestly deprecate putting our Agricultural or Commercial
and Manufacturing interests into <i>competition</i> with eachother,
as needless and mischievous. Both are essential elements
in the national welfare; both should be upheld to the utmost:
but if circumstances <i>should</i> unhappily bring them into inevitable
conflict, I avow myself heart and soul a friend to the Agricultural
interest.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I know not whether it would be more derogatory
to your character, or to mine, to exact or give <i>pledges</i> as to
my conduct on any particular measure, great or small, which
may come before Parliament. It appears to me both absurd
and ignominious, and inconsistent with every true principle of
representation. One, however, I willingly give you&mdash;that I
will endeavor to do my duty, by consulting your interests as a
part of the general interests of the nation. I trust that I shall
never be found uncourteous or inaccessible; and I am confident
that none of you will entertain unreasonable expectations concerning
my power to serve you individually or collectively.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, having entered into this contest, I pledge myself
to fight it out to the last; and, if I fail, to retire with good
humor. My friends and I will keep a vigilant eye on any attempts
which may be made to resort to undue influence or coercion; which,
however, I cannot suppose will be the case.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, this is the best account I can give you, within
the limits of such an Address as the present, of my political
opinions, and of the motives which have induced me to come
forward; and I shall, within a day or two, proceed to call upon
you personally. In the mean while I remain, Gentlemen, your
faithful servant,</p>

<p>Two or three days afterwards there arrived at Mr.
Aubrey's, in Vivian Street, two large packets, franked
"<span class="smcap">De la Zouch</span>," and addressed to Mr. Aubrey, containing
four copies of the foregoing "Address," accompanied
by the following hurried note:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<div align="right"> "<i>Fotheringham, 8th Dec. 18&mdash;.</i> </div>
<br />

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Aubrey</span>&mdash;What think you of this sudden and
somewhat Quixotic enterprise of my son? I fear it is quite
hopeless&mdash;but there was no resisting his importunities. I
must say he is going into the affair (which has already made
a prodigious stir down here) in a very fine spirit. His <i>Address</i>
is good, is it not? The only thing I regret is, his entering
the lists with such a creature as that fellow Titmouse&mdash;and,
moreover, being <i>beaten</i> by him.&mdash;Yours ever faithfully
and affectionately,</p>

<div align="right"> "<span class="smcap">De La Zouch.</span> </div>

<p>"P. S.&mdash;You should only see little Dr. Tatham since he
has heard of it. He spins about the village like a humming-top!
I hope that, as far as his worldly interests are concerned,
he is not acting imprudently: but <i>I</i> will take care of that, for
I love and reverence the little doctor. Our dear love to the
ladies. (In great haste.)"</p>

</blockquote>


<p>This letter was read with almost suspended breath, by
Mr. Aubrey, and then by Mrs. and Miss Aubrey. With
still greater emotion were the printed enclosures opened
and read. Each was held in a trembling hand, its reader's
color going and coming. Miss Aubrey's heart beat faster
and faster; she turned very pale&mdash;but with a strong effort
recovered herself. Then taking the candle, she withdrew
with a hasty and excited air, taking her copy of the
Address with her to her own room; and there burst into
tears, and wept for some time. She felt her heart dissolving
in tenderness towards Delamere! It was some
time before she could summon resolution enough to return.
When she did, Mrs. Aubrey made a faint effort to
rally her; but each, on observing the traces of the other's
recent and strong emotion, was silent, and with difficulty
preserved any semblance of a calm demeanor.</p>

<p>Equally strong emotions, but of a very different description,
were excited in the bosoms of certain persons at Yatton
Hall, by the appearance of Mr. Delamere's Address.
'Twas Mr. Barnabas Bloodsuck, (junior,)&mdash;a middle-sized,
square-set young man, of about thirty, with a broad face,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
a very flat nose, light frizzly hair, and deep-set gray eyes&mdash;a
bustling, confident, hard-mouthed fellow&mdash;who, happening
to be stirring in the main street of Grilston early
in the morning of the 8th December 18&mdash;, beheld a man
in the act of sticking up Mr. Delamere's Address against
a wall. Having prevailed on the man to part with one,
Mr. Bloodsuck was within a quarter of an hour on horseback,
galloping down to Yatton&mdash;almost imagining himself
to be carrying with him a sort of hand-grenade, which
might explode in his pocket as he went on. He was
ushered into the breakfast-room, where sat Mr. Gammon
and Mr. Titmouse, just finishing their morning
meal.</p>

<p>"My stars&mdash;good-morning! gents,&mdash;but here's a kettle
of fish!" quoth Mr. Bloodsuck, with an excited air,
wiping the perspiration from his forehead; and then plucking
out of his pocket the damp and crumpled Address of
Mr. Delamere, he handed it to Mr. Gammon, who changed
color on seeing it, and read it over in silence.</p>

<p>Mr. Titmouse looked at him with a disturbed air; and
having finished his mixture of tea and brandy, "Eh&mdash;e&mdash;eh,
Gammon!&mdash;I say"&mdash;he stammered&mdash;"what's
in the wind? 'Pon my soul, you look&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a piece of good fortune, for which you
are indebted to your distinguished friend, Mr. Phelim
O'Something," replied Gammon, bitterly, "whose precious
Address has called forth for you an opponent whom you
would not otherwise have had."</p>

<p>"Hang Mr. O'Doodle!" exclaimed Titmouse; "I&mdash;'pon
my precious soul&mdash;I always thought him a-a fool
and a knave. I'll make him pay me the money he owes
me!" and he strode up and down the room, with his
hands thrust furiously into his pockets.</p>

<p>"You had perhaps better direct your powerful mind to
this Address," quoth Mr. Gammon, with a blighting smile,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
"as it slightly concerns you;" and handing it to Titmouse,
the latter sat down to try and obey him.</p>

<p>"That cock won't <i>really</i> fight, though, eh?" inquired
Mr. Bloodsuck, as he resumed his seat after helping himself
to an enormous slice of cold beef at the side table.</p>

<p>"I think it <i>will</i>," replied Mr. Gammon, thoughtfully:
and presently continued after a pause, with a visible effort
to speak calmly, "it is useless to say anything about
the haughty intolerant Toryism it displays; that is all
fair; but <i>is</i> it not hard, Mr. Bloodsuck, that when I had
written an Address which would have effectually"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Phelim O'Doodle owes me three hundred pounds,
Gammon, and I hope you'll get it for me at once; 'pon
my soul, he's a most cursed scamp," quoth Titmouse, furiously,
looking up with an air of desperate chagrin, on
hearing Gammon's last words. That gentleman, however,
took no notice of him, and proceeded, addressing Mr. Bloodsuck,
"I have weighed every word in that Address. <i>It
means mischief.</i> It has evidently been well considered;
it is calm and determined&mdash;and we shall have a desperate
contest, or I am grievously mistaken."</p>

<p>"E&mdash;e&mdash;eh? E&mdash;h? What, Gammon?" inquired
Titmouse, who, though his eye appeared, in obedience
to Gammon, to have been travelling over the all-important
document which he held in his hand, had been
listening with trembling anxiety to what was said by
his companions.</p>

<p>"I say that we are to have a contested election: that
you won't walk over the course, as you might have done.
Here's a most formidable opponent started against you!"</p>

<p>"What? 'Pon my soul&mdash;for <i>my</i> borough? For
Yatton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and one who will fight you tooth and nail."</p>

<p>"'Pon&mdash;my&mdash;precious soul! What a cursed scamp!
What a most infernal black&mdash;&mdash;Who is it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span></p>

<p>"No <i>blackguard</i>, sir," interrupted Gammon, very sternly;
"but&mdash;a gentleman, perhaps, even, every way equal to
yourself," he added with a cruel smile, "the Honorable
Mr. Delamere, the son and heir of Lord De la Zouch."</p>

<p>"By jingo! you don't say so! Why, he's a hundred
thousand a-year," interrupted Titmouse, turning very pale.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> he has, at least," interposed Mr. Bloodsuck,
who had nearly finished a rapid and most disgusting breakfast;
"and two such bitter Tories you never saw or heard
of before&mdash;for, like father, like son."</p>

<p>"Egad! is it?" inquired Titmouse, completely crestfallen.
"Well! and what if&mdash;eh, Gammon? Isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It is a very serious business, sir, indeed," quoth Gammon,
gravely.</p>

<p>"By Jove&mdash;isn't it a cursed piece of&mdash;impudence!
What? Come into <i>my borough</i>? He might as well come
into my house! Isn't one as much mine, as the other?
It's as bad as housebreaking&mdash;but we're beforehand with
him, anyhow, with those prime chaps at Gr&mdash;&mdash;" Mr.
Bloodsuck's teeth chattered; he glanced towards the door;
and Gammon gave Titmouse a look which almost paralyzed,
and at all events silenced him.</p>

<p>"They'll bleed freely?" said Bloodsuck, by-and-by,
with a desperate effort to look concerned&mdash;whereas he
was in a secret ecstasy at the profitable work in prospect
for their house.</p>

<p>"Lord De la Zouch would not have entered into this
thing if he had not some end in view which he considers
attainable&mdash;and as for money"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that," said Bloodsuck, with a matter-of-fact
air, "ten thousand pounds to him is a mere drop in
the bucket."</p>

<p>"O Lord! O Lord! and must <i>I</i> spend money too?"
inquired Titmouse, with a look of ludicrous alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must talk this matter over alone, Mr. Bloodsuck,"
said Gammon, anxiously&mdash;"shall we go to Grilston, or
will you fetch your father hither?"'</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, Gammon," quoth Titmouse, desperately,
and snapping his finger and thumb, "those cursed Aubreys,
you may depend on 't, are at the bottom of all
this"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> there's not the least doubt of," quoth Bloodsuck,
as he buttoned up his coat with a matter-of-fact
air; but the words of Titmouse caused Mr. Gammon
suddenly to dart first at one, and then at the other of the
speakers, a keen penetrating glance; and presently his
expressive countenance showed that <i>surprise</i> had been succeeded
by deep chagrin, which soon settled into gloomy
thoughtfulness.</p>

An important and salutary improvement in the law of libel, especially
in the case of newspapers, was effected in 1843, by statute
6 and 7 Vict. c. 96. Till then the <small>TRUTH</small> was inadmissible as a
<i>justification</i> on a criminal prosecution for libel&mdash;the rule being
that the greater the truth the greater was the libel&mdash;by which was
meant its greater tendency to a breach of the peace. Now, however,
the defendant may <i>defend</i> himself against an indictment or information,
by pleading that the charge was true, and that it was for the
public benefit that it should have been published; but he must
specially state in his plea the particular facts by reason of which it
was for the public benefit. If such plea, or evidence in support of
it, should be false or malicious, the act allows that circumstance to
be taken into consideration in awarding punishment. A serious
amount of fine, imprisonment, and hard labor, may be inflicted for
publishing, or threatening (with intent to extort money) to publish,
a false and malicious libel. In <i>civil</i> proceedings a defendant may
plead that he was not guilty of <i>actual</i> malice or <i>gross</i> negligence;
and offered to publish, or published, a full apology, in which case
he may pay money into court by way of amends; and in all actions
of defamation he may show an apology, or offer of one, in mitigation
of damages. This statute does not extend to Scotland.</p></div>

The great increase of business alone, is the cause of the accumulation
of arrears&mdash;especially in the Queen's Bench, which is almost
overpowered by the enormous pressure of its criminal business.
All the three superior courts have recently adopted post-terminal
fittings, to enable them to despatch their arrears; an act of Parliament
having been passed (stat. 1 and 2 Vict. c. 32) for that
purpose.</p></div>

If the reader will refer to vol. i. p. 490, he may see how the
<i>disabilities</i> here alluded to arose, and affected the case. The doctrine
of "adverse possession" is founded on the anxiety of our
law to secure quietude of title. It gives every reasonable facility
for the assertion of just rights against wrongful possessors of property;
but with equal reasonableness fixes a limit to immunity from
the consequences of negligent acquiescence under usurpation, considering
it, in a word, better policy to protect a person in possession,
than to encourage a struggle for it among strangers. <i>Vigilantibus
non dormientibus jura subveniunt</i>, is the maxim of the common
law, on which also the statute law has often acted, and recently
with great effect, by stat. 3 and 4 Will. 4, c. 27, (passed on the
24th July 1833.) By its provisions, many of the most subtle and
difficult questions concerning the nature of "possession" are got
rid of; and the period of twenty years from the commencement of
the rights of possession, fixed as that within which alone an action
or suit in equity for the recovery of lands must be brought&mdash;unless
a party was, when his right accrued, laboring under the <i>disability</i>
of infancy, coverture, insanity, or absence beyond seas: in any of
which cases an extension of <i>ten</i> years is allowed: but it is expressly
provided, that however numerous such disabilities may have been&mdash;however
long and uninterruptedly they may have lasted&mdash;<i>forty</i>
years shall be absolutely the limit within which the action or suit
must be brought from the time of the <i>right first accruing</i>. If the
statute "once begin to run," as the lawyers say, "nothing can
stop it." The above constitute some of the boldest and best of the
great alterations recently effected in our English system of real
property law. A far longer period than the present one was requisite
to constitute "adverse possession" at the time mentioned in
the text.</p></div>

It might be inferred, from a somewhat loose statement in an
English law treatise, that in a case like that of Mr. Aubrey&mdash;viz.
of possession of property in entire ignorance that it belonged to
another&mdash;a Court of Equity would protect against the rightful
owner's claim for the mesne profits.  Such, however, is by no
means the case.  Mr. Titmouse had recovered at law&mdash;by the
superior strength of his title, and without requiring any assistance
whatever from a Court of Equity; the mesne profits, therefore, were
absolutely his&mdash;and any interference, by a Court of Equity, to deprive
him of them, would have been an act of direct spoliation. Such a
notion, therefore, is utterly destitute of foundation. If Mr. Titmouse
had been compelled to seek the assistance of a Court of
Equity in order to prosecute his claim, and had clearly been guilty
of negligence or fraud; it is possible that some terms might have
been imposed upon him, with reference to the mesne profits to be
wrung from his comparatively-speaking innocent opponent&mdash;but
even then, it is conceived that Equity would be very slow and
jealous in exercising such a stretch of power. The Roman law
took a different view of the subject, regarding him&mdash;<i>qui justas
causas habuisset quare bona ad se pertinere existimasset</i>, (Dig. Lib.
v. Tit. iii. 1, 20, &amp;c.)&mdash;with great leniency, and exempting him
from payment of mesne profits accrued previous to the action.
According to the law of Scotland, a <i>bonâ fide</i> possessor evicted
(i. e. turned out) by a person having a better right, is entitled to
retain the fruits or profits (called "<i>violent profits</i>") which he may
have reaped or received during his <i>bonâ fide</i> possession. It would
seem, however, that this doctrine is based not solely upon the <i>bonâ
fide</i> ignorance of the ousted party, but upon the concurring <i>negligence</i>
and <i>delay</i> of his victorious opponent.</p></div>

"<i>Mayhem</i>," saith Blackstone, "is a battery attended with this
aggravating circumstance: that thereby the party injured is forever
disabled from making so good a defence against future external

injuries, as before he might have done. Among these defensive members
are reckoned not only arms and legs, but a finger, an eye, and
a <i>fore-tooth</i>; but the loss of one of the <i>jaw</i>-teeth, is no <i>mayhem</i> at
common law, for they can be of no use in fighting."&mdash;3 <i>Black.

In the year 1838, arrest on mesne process was abolished by
statute 1 and 2 Vict. c. 110, (which recited that "the power of
arrest upon mesne process was unnecessarily extensive and severe,
and ought to be relaxed,") except in cases where a debtor may be
arrested by order of a judge, to prevent his quitting the kingdom.
In the year 1844, the legislature went so far (stat. 7 and 8 Vict.
c. 96, § 58) as to abolish arrest on <i>final</i> process, in all cases of debts
not exceeding £20, independently of costs. The policy of this
measure is gravely questionable.</p></div>

portion of the work, with several complimentary communications
on the subject of Sir Gorgeous Tintack's feats in heraldry: and one
gentleman eminent in that science, and to whom the author is indebted
for the annexed spirited drawing, has requested the author
to annex to the separate edition, as he now does, the two following
very curious extracts from old heraldic writers:&mdash;the first, supporting
the author's ridicule of the prevalent folly of devising complicated
coats of arms; and the second being a very remarkable
specimen of the extent to which an enthusiast in the science was
carried on its behalf.

known by, it is of necessitie that the same should be <i>apparent</i>,

of them together, doth hinder the vse for which they are provided.&mdash;As

had as good skill as <i>Robert Glower</i>, late Somerset that dead is, and

When once a man's necessities have compelled him to subscribe
his name to the three magical letters "I. O. U.," he is liable for
the sum specified in it to any one simply producing it, though it be
addressed to no one, and no proof be given that "U" means the
plaintiff, (see <i>Curtis</i> v. <i>Rickards</i>, Manning and Grainger, 46; and
<i>Douglas</i> v. <i>Hone</i>, 12 Adolphus and Ellis, 641,) unless the defendant
be able to adduce clear evidence impeaching the plaintiff's right to
recover.

Some have imagined this to be an allusion to a disclosure pretended
by M. Thiers, a few years ago, <i>after the death of Lord
Holland</i>, to have been made to him by that nobleman, of what
had passed at a Cabinet council!!
